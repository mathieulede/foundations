I was a little boy

Well, I'll hurt them,
but I won't kill them.

Those boys are of far more value

Robb will have sent a force

We can't risk it.

Billy climbs a tree

You've never seen me

<i>We got a good start on them,</i>

75
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,937
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

76
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,542
You're a boy who's
never been with a girl.

00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:51,023
What, stones?

81
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,725
Or bone?

82
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,161
Neither.

all swollen

00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:10,242
and bruised if you
don't use them.

87
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,044
Of course, maybe that's
just what the lads say

88
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:14,713
when they want me
feeling sorry for them.

89
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:17,082
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

90
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,686
Are there no girl crows?

91
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,489
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

92
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,591
So the lads just do it
with each other?

93
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,493
No.

94
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,028
- Never?
- Never.

95
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,631
We swore an oath.

96
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,967
You have sheep at the Wall?

97
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,171
With your hands, then?

98
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:43,342
No wonder
you're all so miserable.

99
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:44,844
Would you please shut up?

100
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,013
( Mocking )
Would you please shut up?

101
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:50,583
You think you're
better than me, crow.

102
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,152
- I'm a free woman...
- You're a free woman?

103
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,455
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

104
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,423
If you're my prisoner,
you're not a free woman.

105
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,058
That's what "prisoner" means.

106
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,160
And you think you're free?

107
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,163
You swore some stupid oath

108
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,665
and now you can never
touch a girl.

109
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,167
It was my choice
to say the words.

110
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:10,069
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

111
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,071
But you chose
never to touch them.

112
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,808
That's the price you pay if you want
to be a man of the Night's Watch.

113
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,676
So instead of getting
naked with a girl,

114
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,245
you'd prefer
to invade our lands...

115
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,946
Invade your lands?

116
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:21,915
Wildlings raid
our lands all the time.

117
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,852
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

118
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,855
They're not your lands!

119
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,924
We've been here the whole time.

120
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,849
You lot came along
and just put up a big wall

121
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:32,528
and said it was yours.

122
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,164
My father was Ned Stark.

123
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,166
I have the blood

124

So why are you fighting us?

126
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:03,028
Go on.

127
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:10,603
Now I want you
to tell me what happened.

128

Wolfsbane...

132
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,019
A rare substance.

133
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,487
This is no common assassin.

134
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,656
We hanged 20 men last night.

135
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:35,492
I don't care if you hanged 100.

136
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:37,027
A man tried to kill me.

137
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:39,096
I want his name
and I want his head.

from the Brotherhood
Without Banners.

140
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:46,271
Pretentious name
for a band of outlaws.

141
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,873
We can't allow rebels
behind our lines

142
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,976
to harass us with impunity.

143
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,111
We look like fools
and they look like heroes.

144
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,879
<i>That's how kings fall.</i>

145
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,082
I want them dead, every one.

146
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:58,883
Killing them isn't the problem.

147
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,853
<i>It's finding them.</i>

148
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:03,155
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

149
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:05,290
I always thought you had
a talent for violence.

150
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,927
Burn the villages,
burn the farms.

151
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:11,330
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

152
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,798
Mmm.

153
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,503
Is that mutton?

154
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,038
Yes, My Lord.

155
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,640
Don't like mutton.

156
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,609
I'll bring something else.

157
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:25,745
Leave it.

158
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,281
- Are you hungry?
- No.

159
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:30,949
Of course you are.

160
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,517
Eat.

161
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:35,787
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

162
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:39,991
It's bad manners
to refuse a Lord's offer.

163
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:42,127
Sit.

164
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:44,696
Eat.

165
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,233
You're small for your age.

166
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,870
I suppose you've been
underfed your whole life.

167
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,605
I eat a lot.

168
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,809
- <i>I just don't grow.</i>
- Hmm.

169
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:05,017
This will be my last war,

170
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:07,186
win or lose.

171
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,290
Have you ever lost before?

172
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:13,327
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

173
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:24,005
But this is the one
I'll be remembered for.

174
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,675
<i>The "War of Five Kings"
they're calling it.</i>

175
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:31,247
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

176
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,685
Do you know what legacy means?

177
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,256
It's what you pass down
to your children

178
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,659
and your children's children.

179
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,729
It's what remains of you
when you're gone.

180
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:53,636
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

181
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,007
The greatest fortress
ever built...

182
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,577
The tallest towers,
the strongest walls.

183
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:05,148
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

184
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,318
35. Can you imagine?

185
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,986
Look at it now...

186
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,989
<i>A blasted ruin.</i>

187
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,092
Do you know what happened?

188
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,427
Dragons?

189
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:22,532
Yes, dragons happened.

190
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:29,472
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

191
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:34,743
A million men could have marched
on these walls

192
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,146
and a million men
would have been repelled.

193
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,784
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire... mm.

194
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:46,220
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

195
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:51,191
Aegon Targaryen
changed the rules.

196
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:54,193
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

197
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:56,329
300 years after his death.

198
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,732
Aegon and his sisters.

199
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,334
Mm?

200
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:04,604
It wasn't just Aegon
riding his dragon.

201
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,473
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

202
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:08,776
Correct.

203
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,045
A student of history, are you?

204
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,548
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

205
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:15,417
Visenya rode Vhagar.

206
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:19,721
I'm sure I knew that
when I was a boy.

207
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:24,060
Visenya Targaryen
was a great warrior.

208
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,996
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

209
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,332
Hmm.

210
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,535
She's a heroine
of yours, I take it?

211
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:34,437
Aren't most girls
more interested

212
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,406
in the pretty maidens
from the songs?

213
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,540
<i>Jonquil with the flowers
in her hair?</i>

214
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:41,043
- Most girls are idiots.
- <i>Ha!</i>

215
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,912
You remind me of my daughter.

216
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,515
Where did you learn
all this stuff

217
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:51,552
about Visenya and her
Valyrian Steel sword?

218
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,455
From my father.

219
00:13:56,592 --> 00:14:00,061
He was a well-read stonemason.

220
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:04,366
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

221
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,170
Have you met many
stonemasons, My Lord?

222
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,575
Careful now, girl.

223
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,811
<i>I enjoy you, but be careful.</i>

224
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:16,680
Take that back to the kitchen.

225
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,482
Eat what you want.

226
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:23,553
And, girl.

227
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,324
M'lord.

228
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:31,394
Lowborn girls say "M'lord,"

229
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,797
<i>not "My Lord."</i>

230
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,066
If you're going
to pose as a commoner,

231
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,235
you should do it properly.

232
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:41,371
My mother served Lady Dustin

233
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:44,340
for many years, My Lord.

234
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,844
She taught me how to speak
proper... properly.

235
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,448
You're too smart
for your own good.

236
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:54,684
- <i>Has anyone told you that?</i>
- Yes.

237
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,387
Go on.

238
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:12,034
I beg pardon, Ser.

239
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,370
I should have come to you after

240
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,706
to thank you for saving me.

241
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,075
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

242
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:22,645
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

243
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,447
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

244
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,384
No. It gives me joy
to kill people.

245
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,685
Spare me. You can't tell me.

246
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,688
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

247
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,891
It was his duty.
He never liked it.

248
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,993
Is that what he told you?

249
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,461
He lied.

250
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,431
Killing is the sweetest
thing there is.

251
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:47,099
Why are you always so hateful?

252
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:48,901
You'll be glad
of the hateful things I do

253
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,704
someday when you're queen
and I'm all that stands

254
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,207
between you
and your beloved king.

255
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,453
I've demanded a meeting
of the Thirteen.

256
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,288
One of them did this
or knows who did.

257
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,890
You are one of the Thirteen.

258
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,959
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

259
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:14,262
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

260
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:16,898
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

261
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,667
Shall we look inside my vault and see
what selling your dragons

262
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,669
would buy me
I cannot buy already?

263
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:23,837
We will get them back.

264
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,705
There is no we,

265
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,241
so why would you help me
get them back?

266
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,042
I took you under my protection

267
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:32,144
in front of the rulers
of my city.

268
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,214
A man is what others
say he is and no more.

269
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:37,851
If they say that
Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

270
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,321
my word is worth nothing.

271
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:42,924
I cannot let this thing
happen to you under my roof.

272
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,327
But it did happen
under your roof.

273
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:48,930
Khaleesi, many times
in my life I have been...

274
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,699
I don't care where you've been.

275
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,556
You think we're savages because
we don't live in stone castles.

276
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:21,527
We can't make steel as good
as yours, it's true, but...

277
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,096
We're free.

278
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:25,923
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down

279
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,400
as man and woman,

280
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,969
we'd shove a spear up his ass.

281
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,938
We don't go serving
some shit king

282
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,539
who's only king
because his father was.

283
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:36,977
No. No, you serve Mance Rayder,

284
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,411
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

285
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:41,348
We chose Mance Rayder
to lead us.

286
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,751
He was a crow, same as you,

287
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:46,053
but he wanted to be free.

288
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:50,559
You could be free, too.

289
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:52,193
You don't need to live
your whole life

290
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,428
taking commands from old men.

291
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:57,431
Wake up when you want
to wake up.

292
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:00,367
I could show you the streams
to fish, the woods to hunt.

293
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:04,603
<i>Build yourself a cabin and find
a woman to lie with in the night.</i>

294
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,206
You're a pretty lad.

295
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:11,609
The girls would claw each other's
eyes out to get naked with you.

296
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,748
Walk.

297
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:20,051
I could teach you how to do it.

298
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,287
I know how to do it.

299
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:28,127
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

300
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:51,617
( Chatter )

301
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,590
And what did she say?

302
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,259
She admired your spirit,
Your Grace.

303
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,294
And what then?

304
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:07,466
She, uh...

305
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,468
If every man
were held accountable

306
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,470
for the actions
of every distant relative,

307
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:14,673
Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

308
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:21,046
She tore the paper
in half, Your Grace.

309
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,581
You've acted with honor.

310
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:24,683
I thank you for it.

311
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:27,753
Lord Karstark, see that
Ser Alton's pen is clean.

312
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,254
And give him a hot supper.

313
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,758
Ser Alton's pen
is occupied, Your Grace.

314
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,327
The prisoners
from the Yellow Fork.

315
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,396
Too many prisoners.

316
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:39,166
Is there room for Ser Alton?

317
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:42,403
Does he need to lie down?

318
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:46,675
Have the men
build him a new pen.

319
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:49,344
<i>Put him in with
the Kingslayer for now.</i>

320
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,547
Have your boy watch over them.

321
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,216
Torrhen.

322
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,884
That will be all.

323
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,091
Your Grace.

324
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,360
<i>A minute of your time?</i>

325
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,811
I've been treating
your wounded men.

326
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,457
And my enemies
as some of my bannermen

327
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:27,149
are fond of mentioning.

328
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,784
They're not my enemies.

329
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:30,920
That's what I tell my bannermen.

330
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,656
I've already run through the
supplies I brought with me.

331
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,090
Some are easily replaced...

332
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,093
Egg yolks, turpentine,
oil of roses.

333
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,529
But some are not.

334
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:43,631
I need silk for stitching.

335
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,902
I need fennel root
for those with fever, willow bark.

336
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:50,137
Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

337
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:53,340
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

338
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:55,387
I assume there will be
more loss of limb before

339
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:56,977
this war is over.

340
00:20:56,978 --> 00:21:01,015
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

341
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:04,853
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
interrupt you.

342
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:08,190
Continue, My Lady.

343
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:13,362
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

344
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,172
Yes.

345
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,735
The Crag will have a Maester
and he will have what I need.

346
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:20,936
I expect he will.

347
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:22,905
If I could write a list...

348
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,340
Come with me to the Crag.

349
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:28,476
I don't think that will be...

350
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,812
Let the Maester
show you his stores.

351
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:34,982
I want the wounded men
to be treated well...

352
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,918
All the wounded men.

353
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:42,524
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

354
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,995
Woman:
<i>Children, come inside, quick.</i>

355
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,198
Hurry up!

356
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:52,401
<i>- ( Dog barking )</i>
- Man: <i>Can't find anything, Ser.</i>

357
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,271
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

358
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:56,873
We've circled
this farmhouse twice.

359
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:58,508
There's no sign of them.

360
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:02,412
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, My Lord.

361
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,348
I'm looking at spending
the rest of life

362
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:07,318
being treated like a fool and
a eunuch by my own people.

363
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:09,353
Ask yourself, "Is there anything
I wouldn't do"

364
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:10,955
to stop that from happening?"

365
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:13,157
The hounds will find
the scent again.

366
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:15,459
I'll beat them until they do.

367
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:16,860
I'll whip every man here

368
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:19,362
<i>until I have
both those boys in hand.</i>

369
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:22,364
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

370
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,234
It's better to be
cruel than weak.

371
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,502
Prince Theon.

372
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:30,671
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

373
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:31,905
The Stark boys. Where are they?

374
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,174
I don't know. I seen no one.

375
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,110
Oh!

376
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:37,578
Think harder.

377
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:41,783
I swear, m'lord, I don't know.

378
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,720
My Lord, over here.

379
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:50,193
I think I've found
what we're looking for.

380
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,238
Send the old man home.

381
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:09,110
Go back to Winterfell.

382
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,979
Take him back.

383
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,717
Theon, don't do this.

384
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:21,756
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

385
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,937
You came back.

386
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:38,072
As soon as I heard.

387
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:40,675
Do you know anything?

388
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:43,745
- Irri is dead.
- <i>I know.</i>

389
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,982
- She was a good...
- She's dead.

390
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,784
She died alone.

391
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,286
She died for me
and I couldn't protect her.

392
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,056
Doreah?

393
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,125
We can't find her.

394
00:23:57,427 --> 00:24:00,262
She must be dead, too.

395
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,431
I led my people
out of the Red Waste

396
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:04,033
and into the slaughterhouse.

397
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,136
I should have been here.

398
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:09,506
You went to find me a ship.

399
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,708
My place is by your side.

400
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,110
I shouldn't have left you
alone with these people.

401
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:15,778
These people?

402
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:18,280
They are not to be trusted.

403
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,949
And who is to be trusted?

404
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,550
Who are my people?

405
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,786
The Targaryens?

406
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,688
I only knew one... My brother,

407
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,923
and he would have let
1,000 men rape me

408
00:24:28,957 --> 00:24:31,025
if it had got him the crown.

409
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:32,660
The Dothraki?

410
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:34,883
Most of them turned on me
the day that Khal Drogo

411
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,364
fell from his horse.

412
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:38,132
Your people are in Westeros.

413
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,868
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

414
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:42,937
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

415
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:45,173
They'll pray for my return?

416
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,676
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

417
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:50,847
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

418
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:53,316
You are not your brother.

419
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,918
Trust me, Khaleesi.

420
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,087
There it is...

421
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,356
"trust me."

422
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,992
And it's you I should trust,
Ser Jorah?

423
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:04,960
Only you?

424
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:11,099
I don't need trust any longer.

425
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,968
I don't want it and I don't have
room for it.

426
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:16,137
You are too young to be so...

427
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,373
And you are too familiar.

428
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,280
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

429
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:29,986
No one can survive
in this world without help.

430
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,454
No one.

431
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,091
Let me help you, please.

432
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,893
Tell me how.

433
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,196
Find my dragons.

434
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:50,774
Ygritte: How long till we get
back to your crows?

435
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,910
We're close.

436
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:57,448
What, a day? A half-day?

437
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:04,054
You don't know, do you?

438
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:06,991
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

439
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:10,995
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

440
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,098
Nothing happened
between you and me.

441
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:16,502
"I swear it,
old master king crow, Ser,"

442
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:19,271
we were only close
together for warmth.

443
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:20,907
And then I felt it,

444
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:23,643
right up against
me backside like a club.

445
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:26,145
I can show you the bruise
on me tailbone.

446
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,615
And before I knew
what was where, his... his...

447
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,585
Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

448
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:36,656
And I didn't want to want it,
but, oh, I did!

449
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,658
And he spread me legs
and... ruined.

450
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:41,360
The shame of it.

451
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:43,529
Now I can never marry
a perfumed lord.

452
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:45,259
"What will me poor
savage father say?"

453
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,233
Turn back around.

454
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:49,369
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

455

( deep voice )
'Turn back around.'"

456
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:54,841

I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

457
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:56,977
since it's going to be
your word against mine,

458
00:26:57,011 --> 00:27:00,880
and since you can't talk
about it without blushing,

459
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:03,984
we may as well just.

460
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,053
What, right here in the muck?

461
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:09,289
I'll keep you warm enough.

462

Are you that afraid of it?

463
00:27:13,394 --> 00:27:14,895
That's enough.

464

Oh, it's nice

465
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:20,433

466
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,269

Joffrey's children now...

483
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:18,086
Help me flip it over.

484
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:37,637
- Where are you going?
- To tell her Grace.

485
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,641
You'll say nothing to anyone.

486
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:43,776
Do you understand?

487
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:07,267
Your mother might have
prepared you.

488
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:09,670
You flowered, my dear. No more.

489
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:12,873
My mother told me, but I
thought it would be different.

490
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:14,408
In what way?

491
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:17,612
I thought it would be less...

492
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:20,749
Less messy.

493
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,552
Wait until you bear the child.

494
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:26,689
You're a woman now.

495
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:29,792
Do you have any idea
what that means?

496
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,328
I'm fit to bear children
for the king?

497
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,798
A prospect that
once delighted you...

498
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,267
Bringing little princes
and princesses into the world,

499
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:41,003
the greatest honor for a queen.

500
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:48,376
Joffrey has always
been difficult.

501
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,511
Even his birth,
I labored a day and a half

502
00:30:50,545 --> 00:30:52,613
to bring him into this world.

503
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:55,082
You cannot imagine the pain.

504
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:57,018
I screamed so loudly, I was sure

505
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:58,520
Robert would hear me
in the Kingswood.

506
00:30:58,554 --> 00:31:01,589
His Grace was not with you?

507
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:03,124
Robert was hunting.

508
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:05,027
That was his custom.

509
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:10,366
Whenever my time was near,

510
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,003
my royal husband
would flee to the trees

511
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,874
with his huntsmen
and his hounds.

512
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,442
And when he returned,
he would present me

513
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:22,678
with some pelts
or a stag's head,

514
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:24,579
and I would present him
with a baby.

515
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:29,017
Not that I wanted
him there, mind you.

516
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:32,086
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives,

517
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,088
and I had my brother.

518
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:37,459
When they told Jaime he wasn't
allowed in the birthing room,

519
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:40,829
he smiled and asked
which one of them

520
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,997
proposed to keep him out.

521
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:48,671
Joffrey will show you
no such devotion.

522
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,610
You may never love the king,

523
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,511
but you will love his children.

524
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,915
I love his Grace
with all my heart.

525
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,817
That's so very touching to hear.

526
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:08,590
Permit me to share
some womanly wisdom with you

527
00:32:08,624 --> 00:32:11,626
on this very special day.

528
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,462
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

529
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:19,066
You'll do things for them that
you know you shouldn't do.

530
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,803
You'll act the fool to make them
happy, to keep them safe.

531
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:28,041
Love no one but your children.

532
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:31,644
On that front,
a mother has no choice.

533
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:36,316
But... shouldn't
I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

534
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,488
You can try,

535
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:43,491
little dove.

536
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:51,399
<i>( Chatter )</i>

537
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,010
Who did you say
your mother was again?

538
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:03,811
Cinda Lannister.

539
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:05,613
Is she the fat one?

540
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:08,382
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than she...

541
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:12,185
No, no. There's only one
fat Lannister.

542
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,089
If she was your mother,
you'd know it.

543
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:19,894
I... I squired
for you once, you know?

544
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:22,530
When?

545
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:25,967
The tournament the day
of Willem Frey's wedding.

546
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:29,038
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

547
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,873
<i>You did.</i>

548
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:33,342
Your squire had gotten
so drunk the night before that he...

549
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,511
He threw up on his horse

550
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,079
on the way
to the tourney grounds.

551
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:39,648
- What was his name?
- Bryan.

552
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:42,850
( Laughs ) Poor lad.

553
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:45,887
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

554
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,257
I remember you.

555
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,159
You had never squired
for anyone before.

556
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:55,128
That's right.
I ran up and volunteered.

557
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:58,531
"Let me, My Lord. Let me."

558
00:33:58,565 --> 00:34:01,000
My father was furious,

559
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,769
afraid I'd embarrass our family

560
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:05,237
in front of <i>the</i> family.

561
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,807
You didn't, though.

562
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,309
- You really remember?
- Mm.

563
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:13,845
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

564
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,413
It's a rare talent.

565
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:19,216
Most of my squires,
they mean well,

566
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:22,687
but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

567
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:24,588
Well, when I think
back to that day...

568
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:26,390
( hisses )

569
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,399
You were saying?

570
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:38,836
I...

571
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,772
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

572
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:44,509
More embarrassing
than being chained to a post

573
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,311
covered in your own shit?

574
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:50,316
I remember everything
about that day...

575
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,685
Your helmet, your horse,

576
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,421
the rake line in the dirt
along the list,

577
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:56,923
where the sun was in the sky

578
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:59,158
when you knocked
Balon Swann from his horse,

579
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:02,395
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

580
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:07,366
I'll remember it all
until I die.

581
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:10,903
That was the best day
of my life.

582
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:17,843
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

583
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:19,345
All the competitors were done.

584
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:21,381
I was the last one out there.

585
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:26,152
And I couldn't leave.

586
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,455
<i>I couldn't bring myself
to go and sit with my family</i>

587
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,657
at a table so far
on the edge of the feast

588
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:33,026
you could barely
even see the bride.

589
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,861
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you

590
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:38,011
when I knew that they could
never have the faintest idea

591
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,327
what I was talking about.

592
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:43,303
I understand completely.

593
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:46,373
How could you?

594
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:49,310
S-sorry, I... I didn't
mean to doubt you.

595
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:52,846
- It's just that I...
- I was 16 once.

596
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:56,350
I also had to replace someone's
squire on short notice.

597
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:58,052
Which knight was it?

598
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:00,854
Barristan Selmy.

599
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,124
The fight against
the Kingswood outlaws.

600
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:06,827
Before your time.

601
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:08,362
What was he like?

602
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:11,131
( Sighs )

603
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:14,602
He was

604
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:17,471
a painter,

605
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:20,808
a painter who only used red.

606
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:27,382
I couldn't imagine being
able to fight like that,

607
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,618
not back then.

608
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:32,008
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something

609
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,033
that perfect...

610
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:38,828
I don't need to explain
how that felt, not to you.

611
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,531
It's hard to put into words.

612
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,701
It's like stepping into a dream

613
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,904
you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember

614
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,773
and finding out that the dream

615
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,843
is more real than your life.

616
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,383
Leaving that battlefield was

617
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,518
like being dragged off
to prison.

618
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:03,922
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

619
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:07,693
I didn't have your gift.

620
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:11,064
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

621
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:14,400
I was awful,
a complete liability...

622
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:18,037
until one of the outlaws

623
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,640
decided to take on
a 16-year-old squire.

624
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:29,880
It's a good thing I am who I am.

625
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,584
( Chuckles ) I'd have been useless
at anything else.

626
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:41,225
I'm not well-suited
for imprisonment.

627
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,961
Shocking, I know.

628
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,696
Some men are.

629
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,233
Ned Stark... I imagine he made

630
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:51,704
an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

631
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:55,207
But me, though...
My life has left me

632
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:58,277
uniquely unfit for constraint.

633
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,446
Have you thought about...?

634
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,081
Of course.

635
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,984
- Every day.
- And?

636
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,156
Good prisoners breed
good jailers, apparently.

637
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,325
The Starks are very careful.

638
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:19,664
But there is a way, I think.

639
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:22,334
It wasn't possible until now.

640
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,571
What is it?

641
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,679
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

642
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:35,515
You'll only have
to do one thing.

643
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,417
Tell me.

644
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,122
You'll have to die.

645
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,534
<i>( Crunching )</i>

646
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,255
( Choking )

647
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,393
( Bone breaks )

648
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,802
<i>( Bird screeching )</i>

649
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,943
Jorah the Andal.

650
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:41,079
This man must sail
past old Valyria.

651
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:45,417
All who travel too close to
the Doom must have protection.

652
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:47,352
I didn't come here for lessons.

653
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,655
No, you came for the dragons.

654
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:51,757
You have them?

655
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,927
Where are they?

656
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:56,962
Draw your sword.

657
00:39:56,996 --> 00:40:00,665
See what your steel is worth.

658
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:07,272
You want to please
the Mother of Dragons.

659
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,679
You love her.

660
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:19,784
Where are the dragons?

661
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:23,688
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

662
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,095
Will you betray her again?

663
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,966
Never.

664
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,972
<i>The thief you seek</i>

665
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,974
is with her now.

666
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:52,747
Spice King: <i>I did not leave
the comfort of my home</i>

667
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:54,548
to come to yours
and be called a thief.

668
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,517
No one is calling you a thief.

669
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,252
Who is she to accuse us?

670
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:00,288
Please, they're my children.

671
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:02,590
- I'm begging you.
- Begging us?

672
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:05,059
It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

673
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:07,795
Without me,
the dragons will die.

674
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,897
It will be for the best.

675
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:12,200
<i>Your dragons
will bring the world</i>

676
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:15,003
nothing but death
and misery, my dear.

677
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,439
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

678
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:19,408
Pyat Pree:
<i>You are cruel, my friend.</i>

679
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:22,411
The mother of dragons
is in the right.

680
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,582
<i>She must be reunited
with her babies.</i>

681
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:29,486
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

682
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,190
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

683
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,192
where I have put them.

684
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,362
You have my dragons?

685
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,665
When I learned you were
coming to our city,

686
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,401
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

687
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,436
( Laughter )

688
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,837
He procured them for me.

689
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,841
- But there is no King of Qarth.
- Xaro: There is now.

690
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,076
That was the other half
of the arrangement.

691
00:41:54,313 --> 00:41:57,382
<i>You would keep your gates
and your minds closed</i>

692
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,553
to everything
outside your walls,

693
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:03,689
but Qarth cannot remain
the greatest city that ever was

694
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:05,358
if it refuses to change.

695
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:08,028
I will open Qarth to the world

696
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:12,333
as I have forced it
to open itself to me.

697
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:15,302
Your ambition is an inspiration.

698
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:18,372
But like all upstarts,
you overreach.

699
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:21,141
Three dragons the size of cats

700
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:23,477
and an alliance with a charlatan

701
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:26,013
do not make you a king.

702
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:28,248
An upstart and a charlatan?

703
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:31,318
<i>Empires have been built by less.</i>

704
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:34,788
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

705
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,156
and those in the center
make room for them,

706
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,891
<i>willingly or otherwise.</i>

707
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:46,598
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

708
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:49,701
She will give them her love

709
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,504
and they will thrive
by her side...

710
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,741
forever.

711
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:19,099
A mother should be
with her children.

712
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:24,906
Where will you run to,
Daenerys Stormborn?

713
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,243
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

714
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,580
Come see them.

715
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:41,725
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

716
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,493
Keep your hands off me, woman.

717
00:43:43,527 --> 00:43:47,197
Don't enter without
an invitation, <i>man.</i>

718
00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:50,667
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

719
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:53,370
- Catelyn: <i>What is it?</i>
- They caught the Kingslayer.

720
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:59,242
( Men shouting )

721
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:01,978
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
- Hang him!

722
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:05,615
( Men shouting )

723
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,484
You'll die today.

724
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:09,986
Justice for the Karstark.

725
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:24,769
Gut him!

726
00:44:37,315 --> 00:44:39,684
Get back! I want his head!

727
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:43,354
Any man who stands
between a father

728
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:45,890
and his vengeance
asks for death.

729
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:48,159
Lord Karstark,

730
00:44:48,193 --> 00:44:51,095
this man is our prisoner.

731
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:53,030
This monster killed my son.

732
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,100
And crippled mine.

733
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:56,901
He will answer for his crimes,

734
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:58,969
<i>I promise you, but not here.</i>

735
00:44:59,004 --> 00:45:01,306
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me...

736
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,741
You will strike me down?

737
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:06,077
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

738
00:45:06,111 --> 00:45:08,179
<i>I am the widow of your
liege Lord Eddark Stark.</i>

739
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:09,714
I am the mother of your king!

740
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,583
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

741
00:45:12,618 --> 00:45:14,753
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

742
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:18,523
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

743
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:20,458
He brought that
foreign bitch with him.

744
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:21,300
How dare you?

745
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:23,446
Threatening My Lady
is an act of treason.

746
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,730
Treason?

747
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,532
How can it be treason
to kill Lannisters?

748
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:28,634
I understand
your grief, My Lord...

749
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:31,103
Better than most
I understand it...

750
00:45:31,137 --> 00:45:34,073
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

751
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:36,142
stand down.

752
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:39,445
When your son returns,

753
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,881
<i>I will demand
this murderer's head.</i>

754
00:45:41,915 --> 00:45:44,150
Wise men do not
make demands of kings.

755
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:47,386
Fathers who love their sons do.

756
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,755
I will have his head.

757
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:55,160
Thank you for fighting
on my behalf, Lady Stark.

758
00:45:55,194 --> 00:45:57,028
I would have come
to your defense, but...

759
00:45:57,063 --> 00:45:59,730
Take him to the stockades.

760
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:01,966
Bind him with every chain
you can find!

761
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,500
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

762
00:46:03,535 --> 00:46:05,703
There's not much fish
left in you.

763
00:46:05,737 --> 00:46:07,438
And gag him!

764
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:14,811
Since when do you light
your own candles?

765
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:17,180
Since I decided that
I can't stand to look

766
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:20,750
at any of my handmaidens
for another instant.

767
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,222
How many times can you
read one raven scroll?

768
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:28,926
Stannis Baratheon's fleet
has been spotted sailing north

769
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,596
past Tarth... 200 ships.

770
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,767
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

771
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:38,169
He'll be at our gates
within five days,

772
00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:39,904
four if he has the wind.

773
00:46:39,939 --> 00:46:42,674
We have strong, high walls.

774
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,777
We'll rain fire
down on them from above.

775
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,946
"Rain fire on them from above."

776
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,814
You're quoting father,
aren't you?

777
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,282
Why not?

778
00:46:51,317 --> 00:46:53,217
He has a good mind
for strategy, doesn't he?

779
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:56,020
We call it tactics,
not strategy.

780
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:58,189
But, yes, he does have
a good mind for it.

781
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,058
The best mind, some would say.

782
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:02,060
Sadly, he's not here.

783
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,363
It's just you, me, and Joffrey,

784
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:07,565
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

785
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,367
and protector of the realm.

786
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,837
I'm sure you'll make
a point eventually.

787
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,240
He needs to start
acting like a king.

788
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:19,443
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

789
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:21,779
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead...

790
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:24,081
I'm not the one giving
the boy whores to abuse.

791
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:26,216
I thought the girls
might help him.

792
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,651
- Did you?
- <i>I was wrong.</i>

793
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:33,955
If we can't control him...

794
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,590
Do you think I haven't tried?

795
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:40,829
He doesn't listen to me.

796
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:45,567
It's hard to put
a leash on a dog

797
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:48,336
once you've put
a crown on its head.

798
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,375
I always hoped
he'd be like Jaime.

799
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:58,680
He looks like him...

800
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:04,420
in a certain light.

801
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,759
The boy is more
Robert than Jaime.

802
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:12,763
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

803
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:17,868
Sometimes I wonder...

804
00:48:17,902 --> 00:48:20,303
What?

805
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:23,740
If this is the price

806
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:28,110
for what we've done,
for our sins.

807
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:30,179
Sins?

808
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:31,747
The Targaryens...

809
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,360
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years,

810
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:35,385
I know.

811
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:40,656
That's what Jaime and I would say to
each other in our moments of doubt.

812
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:44,661
It's what I told Ned Stark when he
was stupid enough to confront me.

813
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:49,834
Half the Targaryens
went mad, didn't they?

814
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:51,269
What's the saying?

815
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:55,840
Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin.

816
00:48:55,874 --> 00:48:58,376
You've beaten the odds.

817
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,011
Tommen and Myrcella
are good, decent children,

818
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:02,880
both of them.

819
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:07,117
( Crying )

820
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:33,140
- Why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

821
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:35,943
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

822
00:49:35,978 --> 00:49:38,145
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

823
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,947
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

824
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:43,483
Your son returns
at dawn, My Lady?

825
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:45,085
So they say.

826
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,955
Brienne: <i>The Kingslayer
won't last the night.</i>

827
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:50,323
<i>The more they drink,
the angrier they'll get.</i>

828
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,726
And when the Karstarks
draw their swords...

829
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:57,196
<i>who wants to die
defending a Lannister?</i>

830
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,800
Come.

831
00:50:15,685 --> 00:50:18,086
I need to be alone with him.

832
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:21,990
- My Lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,

833
00:50:22,024 --> 00:50:24,592
are to leave me alone with him.

834
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:31,732
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

835
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:36,571
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

836
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:38,039
Is that a woman?

837
00:50:38,074 --> 00:50:40,842
Do you hear them out there?

838
00:50:40,877 --> 00:50:43,512
They want your head.

839
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:47,015
Well, old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

840
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:50,285
You strangled his son
with your chains.

841
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,588
Oh, oh.

842
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:54,256
Was he the one on guard duty?

843
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,825
<i>( Sighs )</i>

844
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,661
He was in my way.

845
00:50:58,695 --> 00:51:00,295
Any Knight would have
done the same.

846
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,498
You are no Knight.

847
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:05,101
You have forsaken
every vow you ever took.

848
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:06,902
So many vows.

849
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:08,704
They make you swear and swear.

850
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:11,539
<i>Defend the king, obey the king,</i>

851
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:13,108
<i>obey your father,</i>

852
00:51:13,142 --> 00:51:16,411
protect the innocent,
defend the weak.

853
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:20,281
But what if your father
despises the king?

854
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:23,918
What if the king
massacres the innocent?

855
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:26,154
It's too much.

856
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:29,724
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

857
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:32,593
Where did you find this beast?

858
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:36,831
She is a truer Knight
than you will ever be,

859
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:39,167
Kingslayer.

860
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:41,803
Kingslayer.

861
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:44,138
What a king he was.

862
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:47,843
<i>Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the second of his name,</i>

863
00:51:47,877 --> 00:51:51,046
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the realm,

864
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:55,051
and to the sword
I shoved in his back.

865
00:51:56,253 --> 00:51:59,288
You are a man without honor.

866
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:02,792
Do you know

867
00:52:02,826 --> 00:52:06,062
I've never been with
any woman but Cersei?

868
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:08,931
So in my own way,

869
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:14,104
I have more honor
than poor old dead Ned.

870
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,975
What was the name of that
bastard so in he fathered?

871
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:21,613
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

872
00:52:21,647 --> 00:52:25,817
Snow, a bastard from the North.

873
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,621
Now, when... When good old Ned

874
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:32,058
came home with
some whore's baby,

875
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:35,261
did you pretend to love it?

876
00:52:35,295 --> 00:52:39,465
<i>No. You're not very good
at pretending.</i>

877
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:41,667
<i>You're an honest woman.</i>

878
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:45,070
You hated that boy, didn't you?

879
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:47,539
<i>How could you not hate him?</i>

880
00:52:47,573 --> 00:52:50,174
<i>The walking, talking reminder</i>

881
00:52:50,242 --> 00:52:53,877
that the honorable
Lord Eddark Stark

882
00:52:53,912 --> 00:52:56,647
fucked another woman.

883
00:52:58,984 --> 00:53:01,285
Your sword.

884
00:53:05,658 --> 00:53:08,995
I told you what would happen.

885
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:11,297
All of you...

886
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:17,270
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

887
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:19,473
<i>and what would happen
if you did not.</i>

888
00:53:19,507 --> 00:53:22,342
What are you doing?
What have you done?

889
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:24,577
If there's any who still question
whether your new lord

890
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:26,246
means what he says...

891
00:53:28,883 --> 00:53:31,885
Here is the answer
to your question.

892
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:35,088
<i>( Crowd gasps, murmurs )</i>

893
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:43,431
No!
