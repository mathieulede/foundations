6
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,973
I've taken your castle.

7
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,709
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

8
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,278
Get up. You have to get dressed.

9
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,681
I've taken Winterfell.

10
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,717
I took it. I'm occupying it.

11
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,853
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

12
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,990
- Why?
- To take the castle.

13
00:02:56,024 --> 00:03:00,427
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

14
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:04,097
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight
for Robb and my father both.

15
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,167
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

16
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,570
Find the Halfwit.

17
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:13,540
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

18
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:15,008
Why?

19
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:17,010
So you and I can
go down and tell them

20
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:19,913
- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.

21
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:22,015
Yes, you will.

22
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,117
I won't. I'll never yield.

23
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:27,220
We'll fight you
and throw you out.

24
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,628
The castle is mine,

25
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:37,098
but these people
are still yours.

26
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:39,300
You'll yield to keep them safe,

27
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:41,804
to keep them alive.

28
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:44,640
That's what a good
lord would do.

29
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:50,278
Think carefully about
what you want to say.

30
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,383
Theon.

31
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,384
Did you hate us the whole time?

32
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,327
I've yielded
Winterfell to Theon.

33
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,296
Louder.

34
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,131
Say Prince Theon.

35
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,202
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

36
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,937
You all know me.

37
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,773
Aye, we know you for
a steaming sack of shit.

38
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,475
Farlen, you be silent.

39
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,612
Listen to your
little Lord, Farlen.

40
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,414
He has more sense than you do.

41
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,316
All of you should do
as he commands.

42
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:31,053
My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

43
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:34,590
and declared himself
King of the Iron Islands.

44
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,826
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

45
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,628
You are all his subjects.

46
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,398
Bugger that. I serve the Starks.

47
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,524
If you think you can
hold the North with this...

48
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:45,834
Shut up!

49
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:49,305
<i>If you serve me as loyally
as you served Ned Stark,</i>

50
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,408
<i>I will be as good to you
as he ever was.</i>

51
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,543
Betray me, and you will
wish you hadn't.

52
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:59,515
Maester Luwin,
send a raven to Pyke

53
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,250
informing my father
of my victory here

54
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:04,853
and one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

55
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,190
Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

56
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,929
You are a Maester of the Citadel

57
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:18,231
sworn to serve the lord
of Winterfell, are you not?

58
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:19,666
I am.

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,568
I am the Lord of Winterfell

60
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,536
as Bran just informed you.

61
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:27,174
Send the ravens.

62
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:31,378
My Lord.

63
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:36,151
My Lord Greyjoy.

64
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,688
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

65
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,257
What do you want?

66
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,559
I was brought here a captive.

67
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,962
You were here the day
I was taken.

68
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:49,966
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,702
Let me serve you.

70
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:55,338
<i>Serve me how?</i>

71
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,840
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

72
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,876
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

73
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:03,446
Put a spear in my hand again.

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,548
So you can bury it in my neck?

75
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,150
Do you take me for a fool?

76
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,618
Get up.

77
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,721
Step aside.

78
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,023
Why?

79
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:17,494
It's your dream, Little Lord.

80
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,965
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

81
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,935
I ain't letting it drown me.

82
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,771
And in a few days' time...
<i>Greyjoy!</i>

83
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:33,878
<i>What have they done to him?</i>

84
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:36,981
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

85
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:39,950
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

86
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,420
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

87
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:47,291
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

88
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,794
You were raised here
under this roof.

89
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,497
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

90
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:55,733
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

91
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:58,703
My brothers are dead.

92
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:01,506
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

93
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,976
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

94
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,245
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

95
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,413
Among them, but not one of them.

96
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:12,249
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

97
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:13,984
If he were alive to see this...

98
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,853
He's not. He's dead.

99
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,955
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.

100
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,257
And Winterfell is mine.

101
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,960
I should have put
a sword in your belly

102
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,528
instead of in your hand.

103
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:27,664
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

104
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,767
But keep talking and I'll...

105
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,605
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up...

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,341
My prince,

107
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,943
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

108
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:40,878
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots...

109
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:43,915
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

110
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,052
They'll never respect
you while he lives.

111
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,575
Ser Rodrik,

112
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,043
I sentence you to death.

113
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:11,545
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

114
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,948
The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

115
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:16,650
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

116
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:19,654
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

117
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:21,155
That was his decision, not mine.

118
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,657
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

119
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,994
The Starks will pay.

120
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,864
Please, Theon,

121
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,832
think what you do.

122
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:44,376
You'll address me
as Prince Theon

123
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,311
or you'll be next.

124
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:48,313
Come.

125
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,749
No!

126
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:53,985
- No!
<i>- Theon!</i>

127
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:56,922
Please!

128
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,824
Ser Rodrik!

129
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,694
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

130
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,497
<i>- I'm begging you!</i>
- Coward.

131
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,369
Stop! Stop right now!

132
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,138
You don't give commands anymore,
Little Lord.

133
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:14,840
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
<i>- Hush now, child.</i>

134
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,977
I'm off to see your father.

135
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,982
You said no harm would come!

136
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:25,751
<i>You said no harm would come.
Theon, please.</i>

137
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:28,588
Any last words, old man?

138
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,524
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.

139
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,659
Now you are truly lost.

140
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:36,129
<i>Theon, please, don't.</i>

141
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:39,265
<i>- Do something.
- I'll do anything. Please!</i>

142
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,934
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

143
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,770
Ghost, stay with us.

144
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:16,871
Ghost!

145
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:18,540
There goes your pet.

146
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,141
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

147
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:22,677
<i>You're right, he's not.</i>

148
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,280
You can't tame a wild thing.

149
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:27,081
You can't trust a wild thing.

150
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:30,151
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

151
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,553
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

152
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,755
their own reasons.

153
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,758
And you'll never know them.

154
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:40,461
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

155
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:42,897
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

156
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,902
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

157
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,837
I said you can't.

158
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:52,907
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

159
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,875
and do their killing
when it's dark.

160
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,945
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

161
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,181
This is their country.

162
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:03,251
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

163
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,187
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

164
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,356
they didn't see
till they were in it.

165
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,960
My father always said
I'm of the North.

166
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:15,664
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

167
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:18,934
This look like home to you?

168
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:22,171
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

169
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,507
You understand me?

170
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,976
No, you don't.

171
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,944
We're at war.

172
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,646
We've always been at war.

173
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:34,215
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

174
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,819
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

175
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:40,855
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

176
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,424
You only have one thing
to give in return...

177
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:44,892
Your life.

178
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,260
I'll gladly give my life.

179
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:48,662
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

180
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:50,697
I want you to curse and fight

181
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,166
until your heart's done pumping.

182
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,636
And know this, boy...

183
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,372
Your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

184
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,607
They'll never know
what you've done.

185
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,142
They'll never know how you died.

186
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,277
They won't even
know your damn name,

187
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:08,213
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

188
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,884
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

189
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:15,053
Now, do you understand me?

190
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,822
I do.

191
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:19,224
You're even dumber
than you look.

192
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:22,494
It's just words, boy,

193
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:24,496
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

194
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,767
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

195
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:30,236
Come on.

196
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,605
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

197
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,219
and they find us.

198
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,457
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

199
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:51,527
Can you read?

200
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:57,599
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

201
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,302
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

202
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:04,140
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

203
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,175
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have...

204
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,746
Girl, fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

205
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,549
It's the one on the...

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,522
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

207
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:30,901
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

208
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,338
My Lord, I...

209
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:38,175
To the Starks of Winterfell!

210
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:42,412
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

211
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,949
I judged you might be
good for something more

212
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:48,551
than brutalizing peasants.

213
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,953
I see I overestimated you.

214
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:55,825
<i>If you ever put my son's
life at risk again, I'll...</i>

215
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,360
Leave us.

216
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,769
Put the book away, girl.

217
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:18,279
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

218
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:26,475
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

219
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:29,457
Give us the room.

220
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,968
Clear all this.

221
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,908
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

222
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:55,751
- Wine?
- Thank you.

223
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,589
What news from the capital?

224
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:04,025
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

225
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,227
Ah, the late king Renly.

226
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,463
Rather a short reign.

227
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,499
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

228
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,468
So they say.

229
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:17,641
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

230
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:20,110
dark forces.

231
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,547
Here.

232
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,952
Men love to blame demons

233
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:30,722
when their grand plans unravel.

234
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:33,558
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

235
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,994
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

236
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:39,164
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

237
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,333
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

238
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,835
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

239
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,570
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

240
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:49,039
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

241
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,209
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

242
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:55,179
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

243
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:59,618
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

244
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:02,822
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

245
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:05,525
And Margaery...

246
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,328
Wants to be queen.

247
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:10,163
Yes, she does.

248
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:15,236
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

249
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,840
- against my grandson.
- They did.

250
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,209
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

251
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:23,145
<i>one day,</i>

252
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:27,148
after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

253
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,753
More wine for Lord Baelish.

254
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,129
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

255
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:43,230
I believe that an advantageous
agreement...

256
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:46,333
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

257
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,535
They have.

258
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,470
Pardon, My Lord.

259
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,439
It's only wine.

260
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,942
You would ride there yourself?

261
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:57,877
Tonight, with your leave.

262
00:16:57,911 --> 00:17:00,145
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

263
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,847
That'll be all, girl.

264
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:08,988
What else?

265
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:11,156
On your son Tyrion's directive,

266
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,692
I met with Catelyn Stark.

267
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,227
Why?

268
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,764
<i>He had an interesting
proposal for her</i>

269
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:21,001
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

270
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,420
- A girl.
- A wildling.

271
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:15,856
We could question her.

272
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,858
You could.

273
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,493
She won't answer.

274
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:22,997
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

275
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,234
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

276
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,337
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

277
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:34,108
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

278
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,944
I gave you my name.

279
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:40,714
I'm Jon Snow.

280
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,122
You ought to burn
them you killed.

281
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,825
<i>We'd need a big fire for that.</i>

282
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:55,863
Tell me, Ygritte,

283
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,932
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

284
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:01,203
Are there some more
friends in the area?

285
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:04,573
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

286
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,143
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

287
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,578
He can do it again if he has to.

288
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,180
What waits beyond the pass?

289
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,249
- The Free Folk.
- How many?

290
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:18,119
Hundreds and thousands.

291
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,689
More than you've
ever seen, Crow.

292
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:24,125
Why come to the mountains?

293
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,096
What's in the frostfangs
your king could want?

294
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:37,040
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

295
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:45,283
Do you know who I am, girl?

296
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,819
Qhorin Halfhand.

297
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,353
Tell me true.

298
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,657
If your people captured me,

299
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,659
would they take me prisoner?

300
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,861
They'd take your head
off your shoulders

301
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,997
if they was feeling kind.

302
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,633
If not, they'd kill you slow.

303
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,671
We have no food for her.

304
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,039
Can't spare a man to watch her.

305
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,309
Can't let her go. She'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

306
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,277
It needs to be done.

307
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,812
- Want me to do it?
- No.

308
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,181
No, I'll do it.

309
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,884
Come, brothers.

310
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:25,019
We'll leave him to it.

311
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,054
We'll meet you at the top.

312
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,590
Don't take too long.

313
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,258
We're deep in their country now.

314
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:46,775
You never killed
a woman before, did you?

315
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,611
You don't need to do it.

316
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:51,847
Mance would take you.
I know he would.

317
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,283
There's secret ways.

318
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:57,553
The Crows would never catch us.

319
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,756
I'm as much a Crow as they are.

320
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:14,604
Will you burn me...

321
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,639
after?

322
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,175
Can't.

323
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,677
Someone might see the smoke.

324
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,686
Strike hard and true,

325
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,921
Jon Snow,

326
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,458
or I'll come back and haunt you.

327
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:41,232
That's cold.

328
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,969
Go on.

329
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,105
Be quick about it.

330
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,880
Do it.

331
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,251
Bastard, do it!

332
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,863
You can't do it.
We both know it.

333
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,070
The sun's going down, Jon Snow.

334
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:30,240
And your friends
are nowhere close.

335
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:31,641
I'll find them.

336
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:35,344
Call for the go on.

337
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:37,247
Call loudly.

338
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,688
<i>May the Seven guide
the princess on her journey.</i>

339
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:49,991
<i>May the mother give her health.</i>

340
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:52,460
May the crone give her wisdom.

341
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:55,463
May the warrior
give her courage.

342
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,736
One day I pray you love someone.

343
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:06,439
I pray you love her so much,

344
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,875
<i>when you close your eyes,
you see her face.</i>

345
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:13,748
I want that for you.

346
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:17,318
I want you to know what
it's like to love someone,

347
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:20,555
to truly love someone,

348
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,958
before I take her from you.

349
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,277
You sound like a little cat mewling
for his mother.

350
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,811
Princes don't cry.

351
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:47,648
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, My Lady?

352
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:50,952
My little brother cried
when I left Winterfell.

353
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:53,021
So?

354
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:54,255
It seems a normal thing.

355
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,291
Is your little brother a prince?

356
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:58,427
No.

357
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,829
Not really relevant,
then, is it?

358
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:06,703
Come, dog.

359
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,144
<i>Hail, Joffrey!</i>

360
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,847
<i>Hail to the king.</i>

361
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,350
Seven blessings on you,
Your Grace.

362
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:24,852
<i>Murderer! Bastard!</i>

363
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,186
All hail the king.

364
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,555
<i>He's no king. He's a bastard!</i>

365
00:25:30,258 --> 00:25:32,025
Please, Your Grace,
we're hungry.

366
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:37,965
<i>- Freak!</i>
- Get the prince back to the keep now.

367
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:40,334
Yes, My Lord. Come, quickly.

368
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,336
<i>Please, Your Grace,
give us some food!</i>

369
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:45,206
<i>Bread, Your Grace, please!</i>

370
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:49,911
Who threw that?

371
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:51,913
<i>I want the man who threw that.</i>

372
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:53,815
Find who did that
and bring him to me!

373
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,150
- Hold on!
- <i>Hold them back!</i>

374
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:57,686
<i>Just kill them! Kill them all!</i>

375
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:05,794
- Move. Move!
<i>- Pull back!</i>

376
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,763
<i>Tear him to pieces!</i>

377
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,833
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

378
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:13,168
And they want the same for you.

379
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,627
Where's Sansa?

380
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:44,964
<i>Through the door!</i>

381
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:46,966
<i>Come on!</i>

382
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:53,707
Protect the king!

383
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:56,476
- Get back!
- Fall back!

384
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:58,745
- Move!
- To the gates!

385
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:13,994
- Come in! Come in!
- Keep him safe!

386
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:16,364
Motherfucker!

387
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:19,600
- Watch out. Hold them back.
- Come on.

388
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:29,110
Hey!

389
00:27:29,144 --> 00:27:30,878
Traitors!

390
00:27:30,912 --> 00:27:32,780
I'll have all their heads.

391
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:34,648
Oh, you blind, bloody fool.

392
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:36,617
You can't insult me.

393
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:39,519
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

394
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,357
but I don't know if
we've ever been cursed with

395
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:42,489
a vicious idiot for a king.

396
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,257
- You can't...
- I can, I am.

397
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,792
They attacked me!

398
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:49,329
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

399
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:51,132
They're starving, you fool.

400
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,000
All because of a war
you started.

401
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:55,536
You're talking to a king!

402
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:57,806
And now I've struck a king.

403
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,008
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

404
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:02,044
Where is the Stark girl?

405
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,613
Let them have her.

406
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:07,083
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

407
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:09,953
You owe him quite a bit,
you know.

408
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:20,330
Where are you going?

409
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,134
You ever been fucked, little girl?

410
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,471
Come here.

411
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,507
Take some men and go and find
the Stark girl.

412
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,475
I take my orders from the king.

413
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>This way!</i>

414
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:43,356
Please!

415
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,157
No, no.

416
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:05,875
Please!

417
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,580
You're all right now,
little bird.

418
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,549
You're all right.

419
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:29,968
<i>- We'll get you. We'll get you.
- This way.</i>

420
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,571
Are you hurt, My Lady?

421
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,239
The little bird's bleeding.

422
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,007
Someone take her back
to her cage,

423
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,909
<i>see to that cut.</i>

424
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,477
Well done, Clegane.

425
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,480
I didn't do it for you.

426
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,216
He shouldn't make me wait.

427
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,721
The Spice King is the second
wealthiest man in Qarth.

428
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,889
He makes everyone wait.

429
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:57,159
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

430
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:59,662
if you married
the wealthiest man in Qarth.

431
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:01,731
I already have a husband.

432
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,100
Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.

433
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:08,004
You are far too young
to be a widow forever

434
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,340
and far too beautiful.

435
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,142
And you are far too smart

436
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:15,645
to think that I will
succumb to flattery.

437
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,614
I have travelled
very far in my life

438
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,350
and met many women,

439
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,185
but none that are
immune to flattery.

440
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,921
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

441
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,956
Here he comes.

442
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,593
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

443
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,262
Terrible dreams.

444
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,465
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

445
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,001
and the birds were singing.

446
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,770
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

447
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,372
<i>now the Red Waste
has been washed off you.</i>

448
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,742
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

449
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:50,246
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

450
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,717
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

451
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,287
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

452
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,857
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

453
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,959
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

454
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:05,396
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

455
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,664
Every lady alive was lovelier

456
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,933
and higher born
than my grandfather.

457
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,801
<i>Ahem.</i>

458
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,371
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

459
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,340
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

460
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,308
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

461
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:22,244
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

462
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:25,080
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

463
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:29,218
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

464
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:30,686
My birthright...

465
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,622
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

466
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:35,325
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

467
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,427
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

468
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,064
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

469
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,866
I'm asking you for ships.

470
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,535
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

471
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,437
I need my ships as well.

472
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,938
I use them, you see,

473
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:49,441
to bring spices from
one port to another.

474
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:50,975
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

475
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,779
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

476
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,247
Retake?

477
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,415
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

478
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,285
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

479
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,687
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

480
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:06,158
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

481
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,226
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

482
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,129
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

483
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,731
So let me explain my position,

484
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,700
little princess.

485
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:19,203
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

486
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,206
I make my living by trade.

487
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,575
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

488
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,243
You ask for ships.

489
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,313
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

490
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,149
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

491
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,418
But before you repay your debts,

492
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,053
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

493
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,755
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

494
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,257
You do not have an army.

495
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,392
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

496
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,561
There are many there
that support my claim.

497
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,063
When were you there last?

498
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:49,699
I left when I was a baby.

499
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,636
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

500
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,426
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful.

501
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,141
Queen when I return.

502
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,010
Ah.

503
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,812
Forgive me, little princess,

504
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:04,283
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

505
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,784
Now if you'll pardon me.

506
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,520
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

507
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:11,190
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

508
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:14,826
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

509
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,729
<i>He believed...
The world believed...</i>

510
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,697
That the ages
had turned them to stone.

511
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:22,934
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

512
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:25,936
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

513
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,439
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

514
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:33,011
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

515
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,213
But when the fire burned out,

516
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:37,449
I was unhurt,

517
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,319
the Mother of Dragons.

518
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:45,157
Do you understand?

519
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:50,296
I'm no ordinary woman.

520
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,298
My dreams come true.

521
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:00,338
I admire your passion.

522
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,243
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

523
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,944
I'm sorry, little princess.

524
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,313
I am not your little princess.

525
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,383
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

526
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,419
and I will take what is mine.

527
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:17,555
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

528
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:21,159
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

529
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,712
Who taught you to read?

530
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,014
My father, My Lord.

531
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,017
Hmm.

532
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,252
I taught my son Jaime to read.

533
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,257
The Maester came to me one day,

534
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,459
told me he wasn't learning.

535
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:58,262
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

536
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,999
He reversed them in his head.

537
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:03,869
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

538
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:05,938
and that we simply
must accept it.

539
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,040
Ha!

540
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:11,544
After that, I sat Jaime down

541
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,748
for four hours every day
until he learned.

542
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:19,987
He hated me for it, for a time.

543
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:22,657
For a long time,

544
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:24,526
but he learned.

545
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:32,400
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

546
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,904
Who was he?

547
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:39,540
A stonemason.

548
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,874
A stonemason who could read?

549
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:44,310
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

550
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:47,079
Quite a man.

551
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:50,416
What killed him?

552
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,152
Loyalty.

553
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,857
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

554
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,528
Did...

555
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:07,667
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

556
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,937
No...

557
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:13,874
But you've already begun.

558
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:17,344
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

559
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:19,513
I did.

560
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,717
I grew up with him.

561
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:27,589
I watched him grow old.

562
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:32,862
<i>He loved us.</i>

563
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,698
He was a good man,

564
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:38,434
but a weak man,

565
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,971
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

566
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:46,376
I'm cold.

567
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:49,112
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

568
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,515
Mmm.

569
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:19,643
Where are you going, girl?

570
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:22,613
The armory, My Lord.

571
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:24,249
Why?

572
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,117
Lord Tywin sent me.

573
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:30,355
What might this be?

574
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:33,291
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

575
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,393
What for?

576
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:38,262
To take to the armory.

577
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,798
Why would he do that?

578
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:44,402
Let's go and ask him.

579
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:49,307
Move!

580
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:53,278
Get out of the way!

581
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:24,876
Amory Lorch.

582
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,911
A girl has named a second name.

583
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,513
A man will do what must be done.

584
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,482
Now!

585
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,386
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

586
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:36,689
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

587
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:38,658
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

588
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,694
It has to be now.

589
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,970
Guard!

590
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,581
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

591
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:08,987
My honor, Your Grace.

592
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,456
Your Grace.

593
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:19,063
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

594
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,887
Lady Talisa.

595
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:44,490
Your Grace.

596
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,061
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

597
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,229
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

598
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:52,665
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

599
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:55,801
But if I remember my lessons,

600
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:58,370
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

601
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:00,905
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

602
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,140
I could find someone who knows.

603
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:05,743
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

604
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,811
Because it's obvious.

605
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:11,481
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

606
00:40:11,516 --> 00:40:14,451
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

607
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:17,320
I'd call you a liar.

608
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:20,757
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

609
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:26,896
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

610
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:30,299
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

611
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:36,972
Quite a pretty spot.

612
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:39,641
Will we be here long?

613
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:42,410
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

614
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:44,879
I'm not a spy.

615
00:40:44,913 --> 00:40:47,981
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

616
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:51,819
You're right.
You've found me out.

617
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,587
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

618
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:56,057
"The young wolf is on the move."

619
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,795
Perhaps you'd join me...

620
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:04,100
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

621
00:41:04,134 --> 00:41:06,436
Robb.

622
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,739
Mother.

623
00:41:15,512 --> 00:41:18,381
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

624
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:20,683
She's been helping
with the wounded.

625
00:41:20,717 --> 00:41:23,619
She's been very... helpful.

626
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,187
Lady Talisa.

627
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,888
Lady Stark.

628
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:28,756
Lady Talisa...?

629
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:32,360
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

630
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,330
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

631
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:38,434
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

632
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:42,639
Excuse me, My Lady. Your Grace.

633
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:52,884
I've missed you.

634
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:56,321
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

635
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:59,190
You surprised me, that's all.

636
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,394
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

637
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:04,796
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

638
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:06,264
I know.

639
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:08,967
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

640
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:11,803
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

641
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:15,240
- I know.
- You are promised to another...

642
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:19,744
A debt that must be paid.

643
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:22,147
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

644
00:42:22,182 --> 00:42:25,918
My Lady. News from Winterfell.

645
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:41,100
Your brothers desert you?

646
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:43,368
I can tell you which way to go.

647
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:46,038
We'll stop here.

648
00:42:46,072 --> 00:42:48,040
Too dark to go
any farther today.

649
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:50,976
Here? There's no shelter here.

650
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:52,411
There's no shelter anywhere.

651
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,181
There is if you know
where to look.

652
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,586
The cold could kill us both.

653
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,621
- If you light a fire...
- No fire.

654
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:05,457
- But a fire is...
- No fire.

655
00:43:08,094 --> 00:43:10,262
Have it your way.

656
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,772
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

657
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:24,310
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

658
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:28,582
Bet your life.

659
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,176
Think they're out
looking for you?

660
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:59,347
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

661
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:01,583
Yes.

662
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:06,321
You're brave.

663
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:09,190
Stupid,

664
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:11,126
but brave.

665
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:17,032
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

666
00:44:33,082 --> 00:44:34,849
Stop moving.

667
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:38,554
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

668
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:40,456
Stop it!

669
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:55,371
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

670
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:58,007
I didn't notice that time.

671
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,819
This cannot be true.

672
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:12,554
<i>We've had ravens
from White Harbor,</i>

673
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,790
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

674
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:16,825
I'm afraid it is true.

675
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,628
Why? Why would Theon...

676
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:21,898
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

677
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:24,601
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

678
00:45:26,571 --> 00:45:28,873
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

679
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:33,577
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

680
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:38,716
I must go North at once.

681
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,885
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

682
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:43,387
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

683
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:44,923
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't...

684
00:45:44,948 --> 00:45:46,657
You are a king.

685
00:45:46,658 --> 00:45:49,493
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

686
00:45:49,528 --> 00:45:51,329
Let me go and talk to Theon.

687
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:54,266
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

688
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,569
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

689
00:45:57,603 --> 00:45:59,938
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

690
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:04,176
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

691
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,312
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

692
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:11,984
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

693
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:15,655
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

694
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:20,293
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

695
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:23,329
And Theon... I want him
brought to me alive.

696
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,333
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

697
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,969
And then I'll take
his head myself.

698
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:33,873
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

699
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:35,808
I'm no liar.

700
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:38,878
All wildlings
are liars and savages

701
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,747
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

702
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:43,116
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

703
00:46:43,151 --> 00:46:46,019
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

704
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,356
Let me serve you, My Lord.

705
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:52,193
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

706
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:54,695
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

707
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,264
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well...

708
00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:00,201
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

709
00:47:04,674 --> 00:47:06,309
Like what?

710
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:11,648
We know things, the Free people.

711
00:47:11,682 --> 00:47:14,250
You know things?

712
00:47:14,285 --> 00:47:16,186
Like what?

713
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,488
How to eat dirt?

714
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:21,524
Other things.

715
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:25,294
Savage things.

716
00:47:27,297 --> 00:47:29,131
Wait outside.

717
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:48,249
I always wondered
what you had under there.

718
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,285
It comes at a price.

719
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:53,587
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

720
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:55,189
I already had that.

721
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:58,192
What do you want, then,

722
00:47:58,226 --> 00:48:00,828
other than your miserable life?

723
00:48:00,862 --> 00:48:02,964
What all free people want...

724
00:48:02,998 --> 00:48:05,133
My freedom.

725
00:48:10,005 --> 00:48:11,874
Well, you shall have it, then.

726
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,745
But only if you serve me well.

727
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:24,553
- Ow.
- Shh.

728
00:48:24,587 --> 00:48:27,656
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

729
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,224
They thought so, too.

730
00:48:29,258 --> 00:48:31,894
He hated me, the man who hit me.

731
00:48:31,928 --> 00:48:34,496
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

732
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:36,331
He never met me before,

733
00:48:36,366 --> 00:48:39,334
but he wanted to hurt me.

734
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:42,404
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger...

735
00:48:42,438 --> 00:48:44,706
You are everything
he will never have.

736
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,875
Your horse eats better
than his children.

737
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:50,245
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

738
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:53,148
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

739
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,784
I hate the King
more than any of them.

740
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:57,653
Don't say these things.

741
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:58,954
If the wrong people hear you...

742
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:01,290
But you're not the wrong people.

743
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:08,864
Don't trust anybody.

744
00:49:08,898 --> 00:49:11,466
Life is safer that way.

745
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:55,145
And where are you going?

746
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,949
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

747
00:49:58,983 --> 00:50:01,818
- What?
- Me.

748
00:50:04,222 --> 00:50:07,024
He says I'm to make the rounds.

749
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:15,666
And keep you warm.

750
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:46,030
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

751
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:47,706
The Silk King won't support me

752
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:49,731
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

753
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,702
Why offend his best customer?

754
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:55,105
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

755
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,508
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

756
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:01,510
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

757
00:51:01,545 --> 00:51:05,046
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

758
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:07,582
Truly nothing.

759
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:09,684
I slept by the docks.

760
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:12,453
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

761
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:15,523
If not, I dreamed of food.

762
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:18,559
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

763
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:21,028
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

764
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:23,430
is always pure and honorable?

765
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:27,100
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

766
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:29,636
that a righteous man
would condemn.

767
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,240
And here I am, with no regrets.

768
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:49,725
Bar the gates. Ring the bells.

769
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:52,427
Slowly, Khaleesi.

770
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,137
<i>Where are they?</i>

771
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,247
Where are my dragons?!
