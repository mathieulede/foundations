Bigger.

00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:36,371
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

26

Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

62

You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

Some of us are just
a little better.

68
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:06,455
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

69
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,557
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

70
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,526
Or don't they teach you to say
 thank you north of the Wall?

71
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,196
You've got a big mouth, girl,
and too many teeth.

- Stop it!
- Hodor.

73
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:18,934
You've been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.

74

Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

touch the ground.

76
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,641
You've been nasty
to her every day.

77
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,075
Of course she's nasty back.

78
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,710
Me? It's my fault?

79
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:30,912
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

80
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:33,281
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

We can't fight each other.

82

We'll never make it

83
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,224
I want you both
to make peace.

84
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,403
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

See?

89
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,914
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

90
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,349
Don't push me.

91
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,761
Shh.

92
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,830
I'm right here with you.

93
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,798

94
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,001
I'm right here with you.

95
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,903
What's wrong with him?

96
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,109
The visions
take their toll.

97
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:38,446
He's having one now?

98
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,634
I saw Jon Snow.

99
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:03,637
You saw him?

100
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,238
At Castle Black?

101
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,941
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

102
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:11,577
surrounded by enemies.

103
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:24,757
Used to be you couldn't
find a tree within a mile of the Wall.

104
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,927
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

105
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:34,666
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

106
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,775
You ever climbed it before?

107
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,878
No.

108
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,848
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

109
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:55,657
You're afraid.

110
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,894
- Aren't you?
- <i>Aye.</i>

111
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,664
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

112
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,067
But I've waited
my whole life

113
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,102
to see the world
from up there.

114
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,610
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

115
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,914
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

116
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,783
You kill someone
for them?

117
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,985
Nah.

118
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,787
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

119
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:27,189
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

120
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,833
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

121
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,471
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

122
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:44,274
Can we not talk
about that here?

123
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,777
"Can we not talk
about that here?

124
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:48,612
I'm Jon Snow.

125
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,648

and Qhorin Halfhand,

126
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:52,784
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

127
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:54,319
Did I seem scared
the other day?

128
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:55,987
You were trembling
like a leaf.

129
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,555
Only in the beginning.

130
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,959
Only in the beginning.

131
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,098
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

132
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:09,001
And don't worry.

133
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,103
Your secret's safe
with me.

134
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:13,572
What secret?

135
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,075
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

136
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,045
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

137
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,015
You're loyal
and you're brave.

138
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,887
You didn't stop
being a crow

139
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,623
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

140
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,666
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

141
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,172
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

142
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,847
The Night's Watch
don't care if you live or die.

143
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:58,250
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

144
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,852
We're just soldiers
in their armies

145
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,188
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

146
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,399
It's you and me

147
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:15,502
that matters
to me and you.

148
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,474
Don't ever betray me.

149
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,283
I won't.

150
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,386
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

151
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,722
and wear it
'round my neck.

152
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,300
Sink your metal deep

153
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:52,870
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

154
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:55,406
And if you fall,

155
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:57,175
don't scream.

156
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,846
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

157
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,128
<i>Joffrey.</i>

158
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,134
Cersei.

159
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:23,036
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

160
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:26,172
You're good.

161
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,513
You're not as good
as you think you are.

162
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:37,850
Face, tits, balls--

163
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:39,452
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

164
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:43,222
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

165
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:46,759
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

166
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:51,029
Show me your position.

167
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,600
Keep your elbow high.

168
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:58,603
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

169
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,539
You're holding.

170
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,308
Never hold.

171
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:07,277
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

172
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,579
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

173
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:11,080
and release.

174
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,015
Never hold.

175
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,084
But I have to aim.

176
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,786
Never aim.

177
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,387
Never aim?

178
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,158
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

179
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,393
Trust your eye.

180
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,599
There's someone out there.

181
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,653
That's about far enough.

182
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:57,792
We come as friends.

183
00:13:57,826 --> 00:13:59,627
<i>Begging</i>
<i>your pardon, m'lady,</i>

184
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,762
but we'll be
the judge of that.

185
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:05,732
Valar morghulis.

186
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,801
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

187
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,607
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

188
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,377
<i>Why are you here,</i>
<i>my lady?</i>

189
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,092
Forgive my manners.

190
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:08,128
I don't see many ladies
these days.

191
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:10,030
Lucky for the ladies.

192
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,594
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

193
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,463
Six.

194
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,359
I've always been
a terrible priest.

195
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:15,263
Drank too much rum.

196
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:17,398
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

197
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:20,134
It's a terrible
thing to say,

198
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:24,070
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.

199
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,575
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

200
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,146
<i>were stories we told</i>
<i>the children to make them behave.</i>

201
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:37,918
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

202
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:41,021
but it was just for show.

203
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,760
A spectacle
for the locals.

204
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:49,230
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

205
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,772
I knelt beside
his cold body

206
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,607
and said the old words.

207
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:01,343
Not because I believed
in them, but...

208
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:06,616
he was my friend

209
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,952
and he was dead.

210
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,089
And they were
the only words I knew.

211
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:16,626
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

212
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,963
Beric's eyes opened

213
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,732
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

214
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,769
Our god
is the one true god.

215
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:31,506
And all men
must serve Him.

216
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,584
You've been
to the other side.

217
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:44,587
The other side?

218
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,491
There is no other side.

219
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:52,194
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

220
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,002
He sent you to us
for a reason.

221
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,806
You have someone
He needs.

222
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,677
Bodkin point.

223
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,614
Penetrates plate
at 200 yards.

224
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,487
Can you make 'em?

225
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,889
Yeah, nothing tricky
about it.

226
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:20,225
Just need decent steel.

227
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:21,559
I'll get you the steel.

228
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,829
<i>Come on.</i>

229
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,099
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

230
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:31,971
That's 'cause
you're a girl.

231
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,739
What does that have
to do with anything?

232
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,613
Forgive me, lad.

233
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,486
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

234
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,155
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

235
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,989
He wants to be one of you.

236
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:54,291
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

237
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,493
We serve
the Lord of Light

238
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,729
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

239
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,365
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

240
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:10,474
You're not doing this
for your god.

241
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,176
You're doing it for gold.

242
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,378
We're doing it
for both, girl.

243
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,582
We can't defend the people
without weapons

244
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,884
and horses and food.

245
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,589
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

246
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:26,558
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

247
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:29,061
You told me
I could be one of you.

248
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:37,704
You are more
than they can ever be.

249
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:40,606
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

250
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,276
You will make kings
rise and fall.

251
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:58,224
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

252
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:05,498
I see a darkness in you.

253
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,969
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

254
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,005
brown eyes,

255
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,309
blue eyes,
green eyes.

256
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:18,512
Eyes you'll shut forever.

257
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,052
We will meet again.

258
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,999
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

259
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,777
You all right?

260
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,749
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

261
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:16,466
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

262
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,568
Wa--

263
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:23,640
Wa--? Wa--?

264
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,577
Water?

265
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,646
You want some water.

266
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,718
I wish I had
some for you.

267
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,102
So let's play a game.

268
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:54,507
Which body part
do you need the least?

269
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,579
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

270
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,915
I'll tell you everything,
please.

271
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:06,486
But you've already
told me everything.

272
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:09,022
<i>Remember?</i>

273
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,492
Your daddy
was mean to you.

274
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:14,862
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

275
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,499
One good bit, though.

276
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,734
The Stark boys,

277
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:23,470
they're still alive.

278
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:28,607
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

279
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:32,578
You failed, but I'm a better
hunter than you.

280
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:36,315
<i>Now...</i>

281
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,317
how about
your little finger?

282
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:40,186
You don't use that
for much, do you?

283
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,389
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

284
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:56,102
You've been wondering
why you're here.

285
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,638
<i>Haven't you?</i>

286
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,506
<i>Where you are.</i>

287
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,308
Who I am.

288
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:05,144
Why I'm doing
this to you.

289
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,982
So guess.

290
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:11,251
<i>If you guess right,</i>

291
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,852
I'll tell you.

292
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,855
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

293
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,292
You win the game

294
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:21,394
if you can
figure out who I am

295
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,962
and why
I'm torturing you

296
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:26,332
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

297
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:32,005
If I win,
you'll let me go?

298
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,809
If you think this has
a happy ending,

299
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,845
you haven't been
paying attention.

300
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,513
Please.

301
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:45,484
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

302
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,089
You first.

303
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,224
Where are we?

304
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,828
- The North.
- Too vague.

305
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,496
Deepwood Motte.

306
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,967
Terrible guess.

307
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:13,178
Now, where?

308
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,182
Last Hearth.

309
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:19,285
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

310
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,490
Karhold!

311
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,031
Karhold?

312
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,769
How did you know that?

313
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:42,208
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

314
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:43,842
No.

315
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,445
It was just a guess.

316
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,983
Very good, Lord Theon.

317
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,920
And who am I?

318
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:57,123
Torrhen Karstark.

319
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:59,059
He's dead.

320
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,695
Strangled by
the Kingslayer.

321
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:06,032
He was your brother.

322
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,807
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

323
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:26,584
- You swore to tell me if I--
- You're right.

324
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,256
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

325
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,224
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

326
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,861
That's why you're
torturing me.

327
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,832
Yes.

328
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,004
You win.

329
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:01,051
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

330
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:04,588
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

331
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,997
I'm afraid I am.

332
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,202
Everything I told you
is a lie.

333
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,709
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

334
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:27,479
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

335
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:30,750
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

336
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,491
I win.

337
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:41,194
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

338
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:43,729
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

339
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:46,499
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

340
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:50,003
But when the King
of the North summons us, we come.

341
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:52,438
<i>Our father has</i>
<i>instructed us to tell you</i>

342
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:55,208
that his alliance
with the North can continue

343
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,911
if his terms are met.

344
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,880
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

345
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,916
for your violation
of your sacred oath

346
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,284
to marry one
of his daughters.

347
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:07,420
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

348
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:09,889
As restitution
for this betrayal,

349
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:13,026
<i>he demands Harrenhal</i>
<i>and all its attendant lands.</i>

350
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,395
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

351
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,398
Harrenhal is not
in the North.

352
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:23,102
It is his
once the war is over

353
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,771
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

354
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,607
And there's
something else.

355
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:32,443
We will do whatever we can
to give Lord Frey what he needs.

356
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:36,047
Not what, whom.

357
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:39,451
What?

358
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:46,425
No.

359
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,694
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

360
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,663
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

361
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:52,532
How old is she?

362
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,800
19.

363
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,401
Could I see her first?

364
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,569
You want to count
her teeth?

365
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:59,338
<i>We depart for the Twins</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

366
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,407
<i>We need an answer</i>
<i>before we leave</i>

367
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,141
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

368
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,210
or this alliance
is at an end.

369
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,813
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

370
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,515
Father is old.

371
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,550
It will put
his heart at peace

372
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,452
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

373
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,322
And his recent experience
has made him wary

374
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,258
<i>of long engagements.</i>

375
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,093
He has every right to be.

376
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,429
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

377
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:45,550
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

378
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:48,654
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

379
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,122
I'm his liege lord.

380
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,357
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

381
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,359
I didn't wound him.

382
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:56,028
My answer is no.

383
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
Listen to me

384
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:05,004
and listen very carefully.
You--

385
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,740
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

386
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:10,242
No man can compel
another man to marry.

387
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,845
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

388
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:16,081
It's all right.
You heard him.

389
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,318
If you refuse, our alliance with
the Freys is dead.

390
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:22,754
He's wanted me for one
of his daughters since I was 12.

391
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:25,557
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

392
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,960
When I say no,
he will come back

393
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,995
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

394
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,864
You're willing to risk
our freedom

395
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:34,333
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

396
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,702
I have a war to fight.

397
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:38,737
We can't win it
without them.

398
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:40,606
I have no time to haggle.

399
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,775
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

400
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,713
You recall that
heroic engagement?

401
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:53,654
I had something
less permanent in mind.

402
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:56,123
I've won every battle,

403
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:57,992
but I'm losing this war.

404
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:02,997
If we don't do this
and do it now,

405
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,099
we're lost.

406
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:12,373
I'll marry her.

407
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:15,309
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

408
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:18,179
It's not fair or right.

409
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:20,014
I'll remember it.

410
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:27,655
<i>I see my men have</i>
<i>finally found you</i>

411
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,757
<i>something appropriate</i>
<i>to wear.</i>

412
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,694
Yes. Most kind of them.

413
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,795
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

414
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,465
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

415
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,500
<i>to return Jaime Lannister</i>
<i>to King's Landing.</i>

416
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:44,136
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

417
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,771
If she wasn't his mother,

418
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:47,906
<i>he'd have hanged her</i>
<i>for treason.</i>

419
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,381
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

420
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,650
You should.

421
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,119
But instead,
you're sitting here

422
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,789
watching me fail at dinner.

423
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,991
Why might that be?

424
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,893
Wars cost money.

425
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,895
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

426
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,598
We both know
who would pay the most.

427
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,701
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

428
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,402
if he found out
you had captured me

429
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,671
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

430
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,074
You're right.

431
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,911
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

432
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,880
It would be,

433
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:32,217
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

434
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,919
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

435
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,288
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

436
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,491
He'll make time for you.

437
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,329
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

438
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:47,166
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

439
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,703
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

440
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:54,106
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

441
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,676
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

442
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,118
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

443
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:11,658
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

444
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,128
Very well.

445
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,197
My lady,

446
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:20,300
may our journey continue
without further incident.

447
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,068
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

448
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,804
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

449
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,606
<i>You are charged</i>
<i>with abetting treason.</i>

450
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,775
I'm afraid I must insist.

451
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,477
<i>You're in no place</i>
<i>to insist on anything.</i>

452
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,646
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

453
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,516
about overplaying
your position.

454
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,656
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- Why?

455
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,025
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

456
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,195
<i>The most desirable bachelor</i>
<i>in all seven kingdoms.</i>

457
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,831
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

458
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:56,601
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

459
00:33:57,837 --> 00:33:59,637
and the mother
of the king.

460
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:01,072
Old.

461
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:02,941
Old?

462
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:06,044
Old.

463
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,546
<i>I'm something of an expert</i>
<i>on the subject.</i>

464
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,182
<i>Her change will be</i>
<i>upon her before long.</i>

465
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:14,719
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

466
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,455
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

467
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,891
but this is another
matter entirely.

468
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,561
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

469
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:29,968
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

470
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,837
The only thing
that might turn it

471
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:35,574
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

472
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,810
- <i>Do you deny them?</i>
- Oh, not at all.

473
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,879
A sword swallower
through and through.

474
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,680
And a boy
with his affliction

475
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:44,716
should be grateful
for the opportunity

476
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,785
<i>to marry the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman in the kingdoms</i>

477
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,686
and remove the stain
from his name.

478
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,956
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

479
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,991
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

480
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,860
squires, stable boys?

481
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,195
Of course.

482
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:02,398
And you never...

483
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,467
No.

484
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,502
Not once?

485
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,104
Not in any way?

486
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:10,006
Never.

487
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,976
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

488
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,278
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

489
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:16,946
at each other
beneath the sheets.

490
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,549
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

491
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,484
for unnatural behavior.

492
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:22,952
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

493
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,255
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

494
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,458
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

495
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,229
brothers and sisters--

496
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,799
where I come from,
that stain

497
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,302
would be very difficult
to wash out.

498
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,938
I will not breathe
further life

499
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,374
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

500
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,011
Lie or not,

501
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:50,181
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

502
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,751
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

503
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:54,819
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

504
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:57,889
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

505
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,991
I don't care
what people believe.

506
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,860
And neither do you.

507
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:06,464
As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.

508
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:10,669
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

509
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:13,605
then Joffrey
is no king at all

510
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,809
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

511
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:21,547
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

512
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:25,751
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

513
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:29,322
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

514
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,891
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

515
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:35,128
All right.

516
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,696
I'll remove it for you.

517
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:40,532
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

518
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,435
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

519
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:46,904
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

520
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,939
He will never marry.

521
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,774
- He will never have children.
- Oh...

522
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,709
<i>The Tyrell name</i>
<i>will fade.</i>

523
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,412
And Highgarden will go
to the children

524
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,947
of Joffrey
and Margaery.

525
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,450
You would have
your grandson protected

526
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,319
by someone
who disgusts you?

527
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:04,956
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

528
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,327
who takes his vows
seriously.

529
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:11,196
So, shall I draw up
the order?

530
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,134
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

531
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,839
It's a rare enough thing--

532
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,777
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

533
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:19,962
No!

534
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,351
We've gotta cut them loose!

535
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,653
No!

536
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,901
Take my hand!

537
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,841
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

538
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:12,378
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

539
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:19,085
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

540
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,793
I'm very happy about...

541
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:29,628
Uh, yes.

542
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:31,830
I-I am as well.

543
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,168
I feel like
I'm in a dream.

544
00:40:36,203 --> 00:40:39,973
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

545
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:42,542
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

546
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:43,777
The guests,

547
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,980
the food,
the tournaments.

548
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:52,587
And the bride,
of course.

549
00:40:56,392 --> 00:40:59,027
The most beautiful bride
in the world

550
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,661
in a beautiful
gown of gold

551
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:03,264
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

552
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:07,936
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

553
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,705
No. I had never
left Winterfell

554
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:13,742
before I came
to King's Landing.

555
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:15,343
But it sounds wonderful.

556
00:41:15,378 --> 00:41:17,979
I can't wait to see it.

557
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:20,115
And to leave this place.

558
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:22,985
It's terrible,
isn't it?

559
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:27,990
The most terrible
place there is.

560
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:40,736
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>there's anything we can do about this.</i>

561
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,038
We can have them
both killed.

562
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:46,808
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

563
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:49,845
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

564
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,813
Probably Sansa.

565
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:53,682
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

566
00:41:53,716 --> 00:41:56,485
a deep and singular misery.

567
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,255
Father doesn't
discriminate.

568
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:02,125
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

569
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,260
On a boat you built.

570
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:07,331
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

571
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:09,901
I did what I did
to protect our family.

572
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:12,036
I'm your family.

573
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:15,006
A member of your family

574
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,076
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

575
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:20,911
Whether or not
you or Father

576
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:22,947
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

577
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:25,283
I do admit it.

578
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:27,952
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

579
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:31,289
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

580
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:34,392
<i>Our heads would still be</i>
<i>rotting on the city gate.</i>

581
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:38,763
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

582
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,968
There are two people
in King's Landing

583
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:45,169
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

584
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:48,173
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

585
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:51,109
<i>to kill me during the Battle</i>
<i>of the Blackwater?</i>

586
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:03,120
The impulse I understand.

587
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:07,258
He hates me
because I'm the only one

588
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:10,161
who tells him
what he really is.

589
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:17,468
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

590
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:19,504
But his stupidity?

591
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:23,541
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

592
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:27,044
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

593
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,247
to murder
the Hand of the King

594
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:31,182
in full view
of his own army.

595
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:32,750
The boy's an idiot.

596
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:34,185
What do you
want me to say?

597
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:37,221
I want you to tell me if my life
is still in danger.

598
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:38,990
Probably.

599
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:40,725
But not from Joffrey.

600
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,927
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

601
00:43:44,597 --> 00:43:47,199
Seven kingdoms
united in fear

602
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,367
of Tywin Lannister.

603
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:51,770
Not the Tyrells.

604
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:53,839
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

605
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:55,307
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

606
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,242
the little
doe-eyed whore.

607
00:43:57,276 --> 00:44:00,278
And so will his children
and their children.

608
00:44:00,313 --> 00:44:02,548
History will be taken
from our hands.

609
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:07,119
You may escape,
at least.

610
00:44:07,153 --> 00:44:08,787
Once Jaime gets back,

611
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:11,323
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

612
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,560
of sword through bowels.

613
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:16,562
When Jaime gets back, yes.

614
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:18,264
But when do we think
that's going to be?

615
00:44:18,298 --> 00:44:20,132
He's out there somewhere.

616
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:25,805
Jaime or not,
I'm truly fucked.

617
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:31,011
Who's going to tell her?

618
00:44:32,413 --> 00:44:34,747
Do you think
people will like it?

619
00:44:34,782 --> 00:44:37,283
I don't think they
will even notice it.

620
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:39,786
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

621
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:42,756
Anyway, from what
I can tell,

622
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,958
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

623
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:46,559
to the ones
in King's Landing.

624
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:49,929
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

625
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:53,833
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

626
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:55,735
I'm sure he does.

627
00:44:57,204 --> 00:44:59,138
Will they let me
invite my family?

628
00:44:59,173 --> 00:45:01,574
They haven't asked
my opinion.

629
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:03,977
But do you think
they will?

630
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:05,612
No.

631
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:14,253
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

632
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:17,123
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.

633
00:45:17,158 --> 00:45:19,526
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

634
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:22,096
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

635
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:28,035
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

636
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:30,471
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

637
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:32,006
Of course.

638
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,709
Alone, if I may.

639
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,444
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

640
00:45:36,479 --> 00:45:38,280
Shae.

641
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:40,081
Please excuse her,
Lord Tyrion.

642
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:41,617
<i>She's not from here.</i>

643
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:42,851
But I trust her,

644
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:45,154
even though
she tells me not to.

645
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:50,660
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

646
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:53,763
<i>and it's only afterwards</i>
<i>when it's too late</i>

647
00:45:53,797 --> 00:45:56,565
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

648
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,734
under entirely
different circumstances.

649
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,603
It's all right, really.

650
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,375
How to begin?

651
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:11,513
It's-- this--

652
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:15,184
this-- this is awkward.

653
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,254
1,000 blades

654
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:22,357
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

655
00:46:22,392 --> 00:46:25,794
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

656
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:28,564
There aren't
1,000 blades.

657
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:31,166
There aren't even 200.

658
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:32,702
I've counted.

659
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,371
Ha, I'm sure you have.

660
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,141
Ugly old thing.

661
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:41,277
Yet it has
a certain appeal.

662
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:43,747
The Lysa Arryn
of chairs.

663
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,549
<i>Shame you had to settle</i>
<i>for your second choice.</i>

664
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:48,852
Early days, my friend.

665
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:51,821
It is flattering,
really...

666
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:55,792
you feeling such dread

667
00:46:55,826 --> 00:46:58,294
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

668
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:01,131
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

669
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:02,999
I promise you.

670
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:06,436
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

671
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,737
You're so right.

672
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:09,573
For instance,

673
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,308
when I thwarted
your plan

674
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,410
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

675
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:15,545
If I'm going
to be honest,

676
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,447
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

677
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,950
of enjoyment there.

678
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:23,586
But your confidant,

679
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:27,090
the one who fed you information
about my plans,

680
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:29,859
the one you swore
to protect...

681
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,796
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

682
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:38,434
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

683
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:41,671
She was a bad
investment on my part.

684
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:46,509
Luckily, I have a friend

685
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:48,911
who wanted to try
something new.

686
00:47:48,945 --> 00:47:52,448
Something daring.

687
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:56,285
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

688
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,588
this fresh experience.

689
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:06,461
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

690
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:09,130
The realm?

691
00:48:09,164 --> 00:48:11,565
Do you know
what the realm is?

692
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:16,537
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

693
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:21,509
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

694
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:24,011
till we forget
that it's a lie.

695
00:48:24,045 --> 00:48:28,616
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

696
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,585
Chaos.

697
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,321
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

698
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:36,891
Chaos isn't a pit.

699
00:48:36,926 --> 00:48:39,293
Chaos is a ladder.

700
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,964
<i>Many who try</i>
<i>to climb it fail</i>

701
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:46,433
<i>and never get</i>
<i>to try again.</i>

702
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:50,103
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

703
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:02,248
<i>And some are given</i>
<i>a chance to climb,</i>

704
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:04,750
<i>but they refuse.</i>

705
00:49:04,785 --> 00:49:08,120
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

706
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,155
<i>or the gods</i>

707
00:49:10,189 --> 00:49:12,624
<i>or love.</i>

708
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,893
<i>Illusions.</i>

709
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:18,863
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

710
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:22,200
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
