1
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,208
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

2
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,834
- JAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella?
- (PANTING)

3
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,001
Myrcella?

4
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,292
(SCREAMS)

5
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,208
Kill us!

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,166
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

7
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:45,876
Please try not to scream.

8
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,208
(GRUNTING)

9
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,375
MEERA REED:
This is Brandon Stark.

10
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,375
Son of Ned Stark.

11
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,208
Let's get them inside.

12
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,875
TYRION LANNISTER: For decades,
House Lannister

13
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:59,584
has been
the true power in Westeros,

14
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,624
and the feat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

15
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,041
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

16
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:06,083
and take it.

17
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,584
Summon Jon Snow.

18
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,375
TYRION: He would make
a valuable ally.

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,082
MELISANDRE: Let him stand before you
and tell you the things

20
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,125
that have happened to him.

21
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,375
Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

22
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,208
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

23
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:21,417
We need allies.

24
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,249
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

25
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,917
Until I return,
the North is yours.

The bastard
of Winterfell.

32
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:08,123
The dwarf
of Casterly Rock.

33
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,497
I believe we last saw each other
atop the Wall.

34
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:19,414
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

35
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:21,872
Picked up some scars
along the road.

36
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:26,373
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

37
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,872
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

38
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:33,705
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

39
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,788
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

40
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,372
Unluckily for me.

41
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:42,415
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

42
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,788
Welcome to Dragonstone.

43
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,622
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

44
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:50,997
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

45
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,748
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

46
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:00,748
Of course.

47
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:21,040
( men murmuring )

48
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:26,915
Please, this way.

49
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,247
Where are you from?

50
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:35,538
I can't place
the accent.

51
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,372
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

52
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:40,456
Ah. I hear it's beautiful
down there.

53
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,538
Palm trees
and butterflies.

54
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,956
Haven't been, myself.

55
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,915
This place has changed.

56
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,414
Tyrion: And Sansa?
I hear she's alive and well.

57
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,915
- Jon: She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

58
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,497
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

59
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:10,663
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

60
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,580
Anyway...

61
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,414
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

62
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,788
She's starting
to let on.

63
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:18,706
Good.

64
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,747
Tyrion:
At some point,

65
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:24,705
I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit
became King in the North.

66
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:26,497
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

67
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:29,289
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

68
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,414
A long
and bloody tale.

69
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:34,165
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

70
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:39,331
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

71
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,747
Of course they do.

72
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,457
If I was your Hand,
I would have advised against it.

73
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,997
General rule of thumb--

74
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:51,122
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

75
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,872
True...

76
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,997
but I'm not a Stark.

77
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,332
( screeching )

78
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:02,873
( panting )

79
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:10,498
I'd say you get
used to them...

80
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,706
but you never
really do.

81
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:21,498
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

82
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,456
I wondered why you weren't there
to meet our guests.

83
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,456
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

84
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:42,914
Don't you want
to see him again?

85
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:45,538
I've done my part.

86
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,955
I've brought
ice and fire together.

87
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:50,247
Strange.

88
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:52,747
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

89
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:56,414
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

90
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,788
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

91
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,997
My time whispering in the ears of kings
has come to an end.

92
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:05,414
Oh, I doubt that.

93
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:08,039
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

94
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,872
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

95
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:14,122
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

96
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,373
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

97
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,289
I did not part
on good terms

98
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,289
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

99
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,290
Why?

100
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:28,998
Because of
mistakes I made.

101
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,998
Terrible mistakes.

102
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,955
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

103
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,164
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

104
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,164
Good.

105
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,414
If you don't mind
my saying,

106
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:48,164
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

107
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,623
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

108
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,747
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

109
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,538
- One last time.
- My lady--

110
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,122
I have to die
in this strange country.

111
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,956
Just like you.

112
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:46,830
Missandei:
You stand in the presence

113
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,622
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

114
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,830
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

115
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,788
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

116
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,206
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

117
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,914
the Mother of Dragons,

118
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:01,122
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

119
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:04,915
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

120
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,706
This is Jon Snow.

121
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,498
He's King
in the North.

122
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:22,372
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

123
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,622
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

124
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,206
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

125
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:30,206
Apologies, I have
a Flea Bottom accent, I know,

126
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:33,080
but Jon Snow
is King in the North, Your Grace.

127
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:34,914
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

128
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,164
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

129
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:39,080
Forgive me,
Ser Davos.

130
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:41,705
I never did receive
a formal education,

131
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,039
but I could have
sworn I read

132
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,331
the last King in the North
was Torrhen Stark,

133
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:49,497
who bent the knee
to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

134
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:52,705
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

135
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:57,747
Torrhen Stark swore fealty
to House Targaryen in perpetuity.

136
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:59,247
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

137
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:01,580
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

138
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:03,997
No, of course not.

139
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,580
But still,
an oath is an oath.

140
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,997
And perpetuity means--

141
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:11,456
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

142
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:12,955
Forever.

143
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,039
Forever.

144
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,872
- So I assume, my lord...
- ( sighs )

145
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:20,081
...you're here
to bend the knee.

146
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:24,165
I am not.

147
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,289
Oh.

148
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,123
Well, that is
unfortunate.

149
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,122
You've traveled
all this way

150
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,289
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

151
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,788
Break faith?

152
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:39,122
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

153
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:40,830
He burned
my uncle alive.

154
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,164
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

155
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:45,248
My father...
was an evil man.

156
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,290
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

157
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,164
I ask your forgiveness

158
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:55,122
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

159
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,997
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

160
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,373
by the sins
of her father.

161
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:05,331
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

162
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:07,206
and those were
the best centuries

163
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,331
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

164
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,830
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

165
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,663
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

166
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:18,663
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

167
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:22,414
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

168
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,830
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

169
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:28,497
Bend the knee and I will name you
Warden of the North.

170
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,705
Together, we will
save this country

171
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,332
from those
who would destroy it.

172
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:45,206
You're right.

173
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,705
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

174
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:52,538
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

175
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,538
Then why are you here?

176
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,373
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

177
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,538
Did you see
three dragons

178
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,497
flying overhead
when you arrived?

179
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:05,580
I did.

180
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,872
And did you see
the Dothraki,

181
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:10,080
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

182
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,039
They're hard to miss.

183
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,080
- But still, I need your help?
- Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.

184
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:19,414
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow
and the city would fall.

185
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,663
Hell, we almost took it
and we didn't even have dragons.

186
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:25,788
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

187
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:27,414
Why not?

188
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,122
The only reason
I can see

189
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,372
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

190
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,414
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

191
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,247
but you won't do it,

192
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,456
which means,
at the very least,

193
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,915
you're better
than Cersei.

194
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:44,789
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

195
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:51,289
Because right now,
you and I and Cersei and everyone else,

196
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,914
we're children
playing at a game,

197
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,997
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

198
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:57,122
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

199
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,622
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

200
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:03,497
he's refused to bow,
and now he's calling me a child.

201
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:07,289
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

202
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,622
Your Grace, everyone you know will die
before winter's over

203
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:12,788
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

204
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,456
As far as I can see,
you  are the enemy to the north.

205
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:17,123
I am not your enemy.

206
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,456
The dead
are the enemy.

207
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:21,998
The dead?

208
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,872
Is that another
figure of speech?

209
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,497
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

210
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,580
The Army of the Dead?

211
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,747
You don't
know me well, my lord,

212
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:34,080
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

213
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,622
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

214
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:38,747
The Army of the Dead
is real.

215
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:40,206
The white walkers
are real.

216
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:43,122
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

217
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,663
If they get
past the Wall

218
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:47,165
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

219
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,789
we're finished.

220
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,664
I was born
at Dragonstone.

221
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,997
Not that I can
remember it.

222
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:07,456
We fled before
Robert's assassins could find us.

223
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:10,663
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

224
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:14,497
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

225
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,040
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

226
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:20,415
Not that it matters now,
of course.

227
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:25,497
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

228
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,872
So many men
have tried to kill me,

229
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:31,372
I don't remember
all their names.

230
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:35,456
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

231
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:38,997
I've been chained
and betrayed,

232
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:41,788
raped and defiled.

233
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,039
Do you know
what kept me standing

234
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,997
through all those years
in exile?

235
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,955
Faith.

236
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,206
Not in any gods,

237
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:55,747
not in myths
and legends.

238
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:58,372
In myself.

239
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,538
In Daenerys Targaryen.

240
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:05,080
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

241
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:07,456
until my children
were born.

242
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:12,247
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

243
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:14,622
They did for me.

244
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:19,080
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

245
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,207
and I will.

246
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,080
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

247
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,415
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

248
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:33,039
The war against my sister
has already begun.

249
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,414
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

250
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,247
and join you
in fighting

251
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:38,748
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

252
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:43,164
You don't believe him.

253
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:46,080
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

254
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:49,872
But if destiny has brought
Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,

255
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:53,080
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

256
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:56,206
You were the first
to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

257
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,580
He is the first to make allies of
wildlings and Northmen.

258
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:01,663
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

259
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:02,747
He was named
King in the North.

260
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,122
Not because
of his birthright.

261
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,497
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

262
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:11,538
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

263
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,248
because they
believe in him.

264
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:16,622
All those things
you don't believe in,

265
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,164
he faced
those things.

266
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,372
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

267
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,955
He risked his life
for his people.

268
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,747
He took a knife in the heart
for his people.

269
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:25,498
He gave his own--

270
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:34,414
If we don't put aside our enmities
and band together,

271
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:36,497
we will die.

272
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:40,164
And then it doesn't matter
whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

273
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,497
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

274
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,663
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

275
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,289
help her to defeat
my sister,

276
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,456
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

277
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,206
There's no time
for that.

278
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,122
There's no time
for any of this!

279
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:53,622
While we stand here,
debating--

280
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,580
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

281
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,414
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

282
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:59,165
And why
would I do that?

283
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,164
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

284
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,372
but I don't know you.

285
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:07,206
As far as I can tell,

286
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:10,497
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

287
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:13,831
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

288
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:17,622
The lords of the North

289
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,456
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

290
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:24,498
and I will continue to do so
as well as I can.

291
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:27,207
That's fair.

292
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:30,580
It's also fair
to point out

293
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:34,705
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

294
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:38,456
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

295
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,372
you are in
open rebellion.

296
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:42,332
( footsteps approaching )

297
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,663
( whispering ) Your Grace, please
dismiss your guests.

298
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,748
I have grave news.

299
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,164
You must forgive
my manners.

300
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,538
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

301
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:04,290
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

302
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,123
( speaking Dothraki )

303
00:19:13,748 --> 00:19:15,081
Am I your prisoner?

304
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,373
Not yet.

305
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,497
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

306
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,955
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

307
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,456
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

308
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:45,788
the rest,
sunk or captured.

309
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,372
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

310
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,955
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

311
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,664
All of them?

312
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,914
( men shouting )

313
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,788
- Pull!
- Heave!

314
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,164
Pull!

315
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,663
( men grunt )

316
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,290
( grunts )

317
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:10,873
Your sister's dead?

318
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:14,414
Euron has her.

319
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:15,789
You saw him take her?

320
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:21,456
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

321
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,956
I tried.

322
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,332
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

323
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,705
Man:
Come, men!

324
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,040
Sails up!

325
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,457
( crowd cheering )

326
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,664
Woman:
Murderer!

327
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,538
Man:
Whores!

328
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,873
- ( all shouting )
- Traitor!

329
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:04,998
This is the life.

330
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:09,872
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

331
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:11,372
( cheering )

332
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:14,206
- ( grunts )
- ( laughter )

333
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,788
I have to be honest,

334
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,748
this is making me hard.

335
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,456
Did you see
Little Theon's face

336
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,830
right before
he jumped overboard?

337
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:27,372
"Oh, no!"
( laughs )

338
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,831
What a twat.

339
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,539
( crowd booing )

340
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:37,040
- ( crowd shouting )
- ( spits )

341
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,539
- Man: Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Man #2: Murderers!

342
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,457
( applause )

343
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:32,830
( grunts )

344
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:36,164
My queen,
please accept this gift

345
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,998
on behalf of all of your loyal subjects
in the Iron Islands.

346
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:42,123
( both grunt, gasp )

347
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:49,164
I give you
what no other man could give--

348
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,289
justice.

349
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,956
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

350
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:08,497
You've proven yourself
the greatest captain on the fourteen seas

351
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:11,164
and a true friend
to the crown.

352
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:14,372
You deserve more
than a true friend.

353
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:17,872
And you deserve
a proper reward for your heroism.

354
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:20,539
There's only
one reward I want.

355
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:24,539
You shall have
what your heart desires...

356
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:28,123
when the war is won.

357
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,955
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

358
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:41,122
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

359
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:43,164
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

360
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,456
shall defend our country.

361
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,915
( crowd cheering )

362
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,705
There's nothing
quite like it, is there?

363
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:56,456
The love of the people.

364
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:58,580
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

365
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:01,914
This same mob
spat at my sister not long ago.

366
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,663
And if you turn
on us,

367
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:06,872
they'll cheer to see your head
mounted on a spike.

368
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:08,372
Or yours.

369
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:11,497
They just like
severed heads, really.

370
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:14,747
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

371
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,331
I would love to hear it.

372
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,372
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

373
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:21,080
Advice?

374
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:24,747
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

375
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:26,414
A finger in the bum?

376
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:29,706
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

377
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:50,497
Cersei: I want you to know
I understand.

378
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,080
Even though
we're enemies, you and I,

379
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,748
I understand the fury
that drives you.

380
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,247
I was there that day

381
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:58,040
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

382
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:02,914
If I close my eyes,

383
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,205
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

384
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:05,911
( grunts )

385
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:08,122
The sound
of your scream.

386
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:09,622
I never heard
a sound like that.

387
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,581
I thought,
"That's true love."

388
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:15,456
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

389
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:16,830
No one moved like him.

390
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,955
No one had such skill
with a spear.

391
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:23,039
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

392
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,497
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

393
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:29,456
He could've walked away
and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

394
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,497
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

395
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:34,331
Now he's buried
somewhere.

396
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,080
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

397
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,998
That must be
difficult for you.

398
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:44,955
When my daughter
was taken from me,

399
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:48,080
my only daughter...

400
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,872
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

401
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:53,122
unless you've
lost a child.

402
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,788
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

403
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,497
to give her
to the wet nurse.

404
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:01,997
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

405
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:04,247
I never got
to have a mother,

406
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:05,663
but Myrcella did.

407
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:09,331
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

408
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:11,373
Why did you do that?

409
00:26:17,956 --> 00:26:19,332
Doesn't matter now.

410
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:30,663
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

411
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:33,289
Those brown eyes.

412
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,998
Those lips.

413
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:38,663
Perfect Dornish beauty.

414
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,538
I imagine
she's your favorite.

415
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,705
I know, I know,
we're not supposed to have favorites,

416
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,873
but still,
we're only human.

417
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,955
We love whom we love.

418
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:50,539
( muffled speech )

419
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:53,830
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

420
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:57,206
That gag makes it impossible
to understand what you're saying.

421
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,040
It must be frustrating.

422
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:05,206
We all make
our choices.

423
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,622
You chose to murder
my daughter.

424
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:09,872
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

425
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,081
- ( grunts )
- Do you feel powerful now?

426
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:20,039
I don't sleep very well.

427
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,414
Not at all, really.

428
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,331
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

429
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:26,705
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

430
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:30,581
How to destroy Ellaria Sand,
the woman who murdered my only daughter.

431
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,747
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

432
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:35,914
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

433
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:40,622
It would be poetic, I suppose,
but fast, too fast.

434
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:43,581
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

435
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,415
She's so beautiful.

436
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,331
The thought
of this lovely face

437
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:51,747
cracking open
like a duck egg,

438
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:53,498
no, it's just not right.

439
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,123
- ( Tyene whimpers )
- ( gasps )

440
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:02,080
Mama.

441
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,830
( grunts )

442
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:05,789
( crying )

443
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,788
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

444
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:17,872
Clever enough to learn
what poison you used to murder Myrcella.

445
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:19,538
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

446
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,623
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

447
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,456
How long does
the poison take?

448
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:30,122
Qyburn: Difficult to say--
hours, days.

449
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,997
It depends
on the subject's constitution.

450
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:35,498
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

451
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:43,747
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

452
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:46,872
and you will be here
watching when she does.

453
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,664
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

454
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,497
If you refuse to eat,
we'll force food down your throat.

455
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:59,206
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

456
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:02,497
- To watch that beautiful face collapse...
- ( sobbing )

457
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:04,623
...to bone and dust.

458
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:09,956
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

459
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,663
Make sure the guards
change the torches every few hours.

460
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,081
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

461
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:24,581
( both crying )

462
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:49,332
No.

463
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:15,123
( panting )

464
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,748
( birds chirping )

465
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:28,457
( knocking on door )

466
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:32,581
Don't.

467
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:47,456
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

468
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:51,123
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

469
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:57,788
Forgive me, Your Grace.

470
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,122
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

471
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:03,122
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

472
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:04,457
At once, Your Grace.

473
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:08,830
( chuckles )

474
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:09,831
( liquid pouring )

475
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,705
No, thank you.

476
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:19,414
My condolences,
Your Grace,

477
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:21,372
on the death
of your son.

478
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:24,080
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

479
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,830
The Iron Bank didn't send you here
to offer condolences.

480
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:30,331
Condolences
and congratulations.

481
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:33,289
To become the first ruling Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms,

482
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,289
that's quite
an accomplishment.

483
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,080
The Iron Bank appreciates
how you cast off the yoke of superstition,

484
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:40,663
freeing the crown
from elements

485
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:43,164
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

486
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:46,331
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor
was a tragic accident.

487
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:50,538
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

488
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,914
to restore order
and rational leadership.

489
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,663
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

490
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,247
Your father never
minced words either.

491
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:02,080
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

492
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:04,955
And you're now engaged in a conflict
on several fronts.

493
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,872
We both know
how expensive war can be.

494
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:10,080
And we both know
gold wins wars.

495
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:11,538
Your vaults are empty.

496
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,039
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

497
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,372
Your wealthiest allies,
the Tyrells, are now your enemies.

498
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,955
You are surrounded
on all sides by rivals for the throne.

499
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,914
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

500
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,622
We don't make bets.

501
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:28,206
We invest in endeavors
we deem likely to be successful.

502
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:31,164
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

503
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:34,914
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

504
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,914
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

505
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,955
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

506
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,414
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

507
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:43,914
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

508
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:46,122
For now.

509
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:49,872
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

510
00:32:49,873 --> 00:32:54,206
How well do wooden ships fare against
fire-breathing dragons?

511
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:59,247
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

512
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:01,622
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

513
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:03,538
You want to
invest in her?

514
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,914
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

515
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:10,164
How are your profits

516
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:12,705
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

517
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:16,872
The slave trade has
entered a downturn, it's true.

518
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:18,747
From what I gather,
she considers herself

519
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:22,080
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

520
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:25,997
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

521
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:28,997
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank
quite a lot of money,

522
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:31,164
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

523
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:35,581
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

524
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:41,164
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

525
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:42,497
Give me a fortnight.

526
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,705
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

527
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:46,122
And when you
return to Braavos,

528
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:50,581
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

529
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:18,040
I came down here to brood over
my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

530
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:22,122
You're making it
difficult.

531
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,789
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

532
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,039
You make me feel like
I'm failing at brooding over failing.

533
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,747
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

534
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:35,705
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

535
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,206
You're free
to walk the castle,

536
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,122
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

537
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:41,289
Except to my ship.

538
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,705
You took my ship.

539
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,663
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

540
00:34:44,664 --> 00:34:47,164
I'm not playing
word games with you.

541
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:49,039
The dead are coming
for us all.

542
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,705
Why don't you
figure out what to do

543
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,788
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

544
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:55,663
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

545
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,872
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

546
00:34:57,873 --> 00:35:00,998
If someone told me about the white walkers
and the Night King...

547
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:09,664
You probably
don't believe me.

548
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:14,289
I do, actually.

549
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,831
You didn't before.

550
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:19,747
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

551
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:21,830
Do you remember?

552
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:23,914
You said
it was all nonsense.

553
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:27,039
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

554
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,164
But then Mormont
saw them

555
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,580
and you saw them.

556
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:33,247
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

557
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,248
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

558
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,830
How do I convince people
who don't know me

559
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:41,580
that an enemy they don't believe in
is coming to kill them all?

560
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,914
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

561
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:47,080
I'm looking
for an answer.

562
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:51,372
People's minds aren't made for
problems that large.

563
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:53,830
White walkers,
the Night King,

564
00:35:53,831 --> 00:35:55,914
Army of the Dead--

565
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:57,538
it's almost a relief
to confront

566
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:00,415
a comfortable,
familiar monster like my sister.

567
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:05,706
I need to help prepare my people
for what's coming.

568
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,748
I can't help them
from here.

569
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:12,498
I'd like to leave.

570
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:16,456
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

571
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,123
by giving up
that easily.

572
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,414
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

573
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,206
Don't go south.

574
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:27,872
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

575
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:29,290
a foreign invader.

576
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:34,372
And here I am,

577
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:35,914
a Northern fool.

578
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:38,372
Children are not
their fathers,

579
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:40,081
luckily
for all of us.

580
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:43,788
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

581
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,997
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

582
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:50,206
Daenerys could have sailed
for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

583
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,039
Instead, she stayed
where she was

584
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,705
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

585
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:57,039
some of whom are on this island
with us right now.

586
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,622
While you're
our guest here,

587
00:36:58,623 --> 00:37:00,164
you might consider
asking them

588
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,914
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

589
00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:05,997
She protects people
from monsters,

590
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:07,538
just as you do.

591
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:09,997
It's why she came here.

592
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:11,538
And she's not about
to head north

593
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,997
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

594
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,497
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

595
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:17,914
After a single meeting,

596
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:20,706
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

597
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:29,332
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

598
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:35,331
What do you mean?

599
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:37,580
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

600
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:41,248
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

601
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,747
- Dragonglass?
- Tyrion: Yes.

602
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:48,206
Volcanic glass,
obsidian.

603
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:50,206
He says you have
a tremendous amount of it here.

604
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:51,997
Why are we talking
about glass?

605
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:53,872
We just lost
two of our allies.

606
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:57,248
Which is why I was
speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

607
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:03,372
And what does the King in the North
want with dragonglass?

608
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:05,705
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

609
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:08,830
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

610
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,997
Or stop them.

611
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,289
Destroy them.

612
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,915
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

613
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:18,830
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

614
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:21,705
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

615
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:24,331
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

616
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:27,580
But a wise man once said
that you should never believe a thing

617
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:30,123
simply because
you want to believe it.

618
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:35,997
Which wise man
said this?

619
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,872
I don't remember.

620
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:41,290
Are you trying to present
your own statements as ancient wisdom?

621
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:44,705
I would never do that.

622
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:45,748
To you.

623
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:51,247
The reason I believe Jon Snow
is because he's here.

624
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,663
All of his advisors
would have told him not to come.

625
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,747
I would have told him
not to come.

626
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:58,080
And he's here anyway.

627
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:00,497
You don't
have to believe him.

628
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:02,538
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

629
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,164
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

630
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:06,247
You didn't even know
it was here.

631
00:39:06,248 --> 00:39:08,788
It's nothing to you.

632
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:12,080
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

633
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:14,788
Take a step toward
a more productive relationship

634
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,372
with a possible ally.

635
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:20,747
Keep him occupied
while we focus on the task at hand--

636
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:22,123
Casterly Rock.

637
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:25,164
What was that
Ser Davos said

638
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:29,206
about taking a knife in the heart
for his people?

639
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:30,997
Did you notice that?

640
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:33,456
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

641
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,623
It's dreary
in the North.

642
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:41,123
( screeching )

643
00:39:51,498 --> 00:39:52,998
Amazing thing
to see.

644
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:57,539
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

645
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,165
They're both gone now.

646
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:03,831
You lost
two brothers as well.

647
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:09,873
People thought dragons
were gone forever, but here they are.

648
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:14,457
Perhaps we should all be examining
what we think we know.

649
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,705
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

650
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:25,456
He is my Hand.

651
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,081
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

652
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,040
I don't.

653
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,039
You know I'm not going to let Cersei
stay on the Iron Throne.

654
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,206
I never expected
that you would.

655
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:41,456
And I haven't
changed my mind

656
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,538
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

657
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,373
I haven't either.

658
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:50,915
( sighs )

659
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:58,914
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass
and forge weapons from it.

660
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,915
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

661
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:06,415
Thank you.

662
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:16,581
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

663
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:22,457
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

664
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,457
( chatter )

665
00:41:47,123 --> 00:41:48,747
How much do we have?

666
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:50,830
4,000 bushels,
my lady.

667
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:51,997
What does
that mean?

668
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:54,080
For the current
occupants of the castle,

669
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:57,747
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

670
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,164
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

671
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:03,622
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

672
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,456
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

673
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:08,955
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

674
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:11,080
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

675
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:14,290
especially not if the armies of the North
come back to defend Winterfell?

676
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,788
No, my lady,
most likely not.

677
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:19,914
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

678
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,997
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

679
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,289
this is
the best place to be.

680
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,247
We need to start
building up our grain stores

681
00:42:26,248 --> 00:42:28,830
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

682
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:31,122
If we don't use it by winter's end,
we'll give it back to them.

683
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:33,456
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

684
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:37,164
they won't have enough time
to bring wagonloads of grain with them.

685
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:38,580
Very wise, my lady.

686
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:40,373
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

687
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:46,663
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

688
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,039
No, my lady.

689
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,122
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

690
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:52,538
They should, indeed.

691
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,747
Pardon me, my lady.

692
00:42:54,748 --> 00:42:57,332
You there, why isn't there
leather on these?

693
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:01,123
Command suits you.

694
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,914
The Northerners
are all facing north,

695
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,997
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

696
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:08,538
So they should be.

697
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:11,206
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

698
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,289
If you turn
your back on her--

699
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,036
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

700
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,060
I only meant to say--

701
00:43:17,207 --> 00:43:20,747
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

702
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:22,831
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

703
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:26,331
One of two things
will happen--

704
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:28,622
either the dead
will defeat the living,

705
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:30,580
in which case...

706
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:32,663
all our troubles
come to an end,

707
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:35,039
or life will win out.

708
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,039
And what then?

709
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Don't fight
in the North or the South.

710
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:47,498
Fight every battle,
everywhere, always, in your mind.

711
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,289
Everyone is your enemy,

712
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,206
everyone
is your friend...

713
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:58,331
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

714
00:43:58,332 --> 00:44:01,914
Live that way
and nothing will surprise you.

715
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:04,497
Everything that happens
will be something

716
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,415
that you've seen before.

717
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:11,415
Lady Sansa,
at the gate.

718
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:21,706
( people murmuring )

719
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:45,123
Hello, Sansa.

720
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:54,290
( sobbing )

721
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,122
I wish Jon were here.

722
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,998
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

723
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:17,789
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

724
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:22,497
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

725
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:25,747
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

726
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:27,580
I can never be
lord of anything.

727
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:28,831
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

728
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,705
I don't know
what that means.

729
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:35,122
It's difficult
to explain.

730
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:37,332
Try.
Please, for me.

731
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,997
It means I can see
everything.

732
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:44,331
Everything that's
ever happened to everyone.

733
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:47,331
Everything that's
happening right now.

734
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:52,122
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

735
00:45:52,123 --> 00:45:54,331
I need to learn
to see better.

736
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:57,747
When the Long Night
comes again,

737
00:45:57,748 --> 00:45:59,373
I need to be ready.

738
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:04,830
How do you know
all this?

739
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:06,372
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

740
00:46:06,373 --> 00:46:08,289
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

741
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:11,039
I told you
it's difficult to explain.

742
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,206
( sighs )

743
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:14,705
Bran--

744
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:17,080
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

745
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:21,081
I'm sorry it had to happen
here in our home.

746
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,373
It was so beautiful
that night.

747
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:34,373
Snow falling,
just like now.

748
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,457
And you were
so beautiful...

749
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:43,207
in your white
wedding dress.

750
00:46:47,081 --> 00:46:48,956
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

751
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:52,040
I'll stay
a bit longer.

752
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:05,747
( man coughing
in distance )

753
00:47:05,748 --> 00:47:07,290
Hmm.

754
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,623
Hmm.

755
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:24,955
Does it hurt?

756
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:27,664
A bit.
Less than before.

757
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:32,080
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

758
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,663
( sighs )

759
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:35,497
Unusual.

760
00:47:35,498 --> 00:47:36,955
Unlikely.

761
00:47:36,956 --> 00:47:38,955
One could almost
be forgiven

762
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:42,538
for thinking that the entire upper layer
of diseased skin was debrided

763
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,914
and the underlying region
treated with some sort of unguent.

764
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:50,206
Don't know
anything about that.

765
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:52,289
I just started
feeling better.

766
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:55,956
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

767
00:47:57,915 --> 00:48:00,538
And the climate.

768
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:02,497
The climate.

769
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,289
You're free
to go, ser.

770
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,331
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

771
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,039
which you are
no longer.

772
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,539
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you
in my study this evening.

773
00:48:14,498 --> 00:48:15,789
How bad is it?

774
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:18,831
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

775
00:48:23,956 --> 00:48:26,663
- Where will you go?
- ( grunts )

776
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:30,373
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

777
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:34,663
I knew
it would kill me

778
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:37,331
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

779
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:40,580
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

780
00:48:40,581 --> 00:48:44,206
The only place for me
is back with her.

781
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:46,622
I owe her my life.

782
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,206
Her and you.

783
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:51,414
( chuckles )

784
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:53,747
Your father saved me
more than once.

785
00:48:53,748 --> 00:48:55,539
It's the least
I could do.

786
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,414
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

787
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,831
I hope they do.

788
00:49:28,956 --> 00:49:29,941
Ebrose: You treated him?

789
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,418
Yes.

790
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,914
Who told you
to treat him?

791
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:36,247
No one.

792
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:39,538
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

793
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:42,247
I seem
to remember you.

794
00:49:42,248 --> 00:49:45,081
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

795
00:49:46,748 --> 00:49:49,872
I forbade it because it is dangerous
and rarely successful,

796
00:49:49,873 --> 00:49:52,206
especially on
someone of that age.

797
00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:54,414
You could have infected
yourself and others.

798
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:57,873
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

799
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,080
But you didn't.

800
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:04,705
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

801
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:08,122
Many maesters whose chains are
heavy with healing links

802
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:10,580
have attempted it
and failed.

803
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:12,663
Yet you succeeded.

804
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:13,789
How?

805
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:19,081
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

806
00:50:29,457 --> 00:50:31,664
That man is alive
because of you.

807
00:50:33,956 --> 00:50:35,581
You should be proud.

808
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:41,164
Thank you,
Archmaester.

809
00:50:41,165 --> 00:50:42,165
Come here.

810
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:49,788
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

811
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:52,457
I need you
to make copies of them.

812
00:50:56,748 --> 00:50:58,831
You were expecting
a reward.

813
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:04,332
Your reward is not being
immediately expelled from the Citadel.

814
00:51:05,498 --> 00:51:07,497
You'd better
get started.

815
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,164
And careful
of the paper mites.

816
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:10,498
They like flesh
as well.

817
00:51:17,748 --> 00:51:21,122
We need to find
Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

818
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:24,622
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

819
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,164
To send our
remaining ships after him--

820
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,831
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

821
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:34,206
Would you have to go
yourself?

822
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:36,206
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

823
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:38,206
or in more than
one place.

824
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,622
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

825
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:41,663
for who knows
how long.

826
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:43,289
I wouldn't be alone.

827
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,872
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

828
00:51:45,873 --> 00:51:47,663
What can anyone
do to them?

829
00:51:47,664 --> 00:51:49,663
Missandei: They can still
do something to you.

830
00:51:49,664 --> 00:51:51,456
It only takes
one arrow.

831
00:51:51,457 --> 00:51:53,998
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

832
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:58,456
What about
Casterly Rock?

833
00:51:58,457 --> 00:52:00,414
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

834
00:52:00,415 --> 00:52:02,997
And what will they face?

835
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:05,414
A difficult situation.

836
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:07,538
They know we're coming.

837
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:10,872
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

838
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:12,497
is to destroy
House Lannister.

839
00:52:12,498 --> 00:52:14,248
She will be ready.

840
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:20,872
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Man: Archers!

841
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:23,247
Tyrion: The Lannister Army
is still the army my father built.

842
00:52:23,248 --> 00:52:25,580
- Come on!
- Tyrion: Well-trained and well-provisioned.

843
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:27,372
10,000 men at least.

844
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:28,373
They will see us coming.

845
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:34,580
They will be ready.

846
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:37,872
( men shouting )

847
00:52:37,873 --> 00:52:39,915
- Man: Draw! Loose!
- Man #2: Loose!

848
00:52:42,123 --> 00:52:45,248
Tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock
are impregnable.

849
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:48,457
( men grunting )

850
00:52:52,956 --> 00:52:55,206
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

851
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:56,748
We will be
at a disadvantage.

852
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,789
- ( grunts )
- Many men will die.

853
00:53:01,956 --> 00:53:03,998
Just as my father
said they would.

854
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:08,788
Interesting thing
about my father--

855
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,705
he built our house up
from near ruin.

856
00:53:10,706 --> 00:53:14,872
He built our army,
he built Casterly Rock as we know it,

857
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:16,955
but he didn't
build the sewers.

858
00:53:16,956 --> 00:53:19,039
That was beneath him,

859
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,914
so he gave the job
to the lowest person he could find--

860
00:53:21,915 --> 00:53:23,456
me.

861
00:53:23,457 --> 00:53:25,289
He was right,
I was low.

862
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,414
The company I kept, low.

863
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:28,955
Women, mostly.

864
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,622
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

865
00:53:30,623 --> 00:53:32,914
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

866
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:34,538
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

867
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:35,997
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

868
00:53:35,998 --> 00:53:38,247
so in the process
of building the sewers,

869
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,998
I threw in something
for myself.

870
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,039
It was a passage
that began

871
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,747
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

872
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:50,164
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

873
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:53,373
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

874
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,747
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

875
00:53:58,748 --> 00:54:00,997
( grunts, wheezes )

876
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:04,663
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

877
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:08,622
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

878
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:11,165
- ( grunting )
- ( all shouting )

879
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:15,373
And so it begins.

880
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:24,997
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

881
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:26,872
They will be outnumbered.

882
00:54:26,873 --> 00:54:29,207
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

883
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:37,955
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

884
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:40,914
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

885
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:42,914
They will be fighting
for freedom

886
00:54:42,915 --> 00:54:44,705
and the person
who gave it to them.

887
00:54:44,706 --> 00:54:47,206
They will be fighting
for you.

888
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:49,664
And that is why
they will triumph.

889
00:55:05,664 --> 00:55:07,415
( speaking Valyrian )

890
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:11,081
( Grey Worm speaking
Valyrian )

891
00:55:15,123 --> 00:55:18,081
( distant explosions )

892
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:37,622
Where are they?!

893
00:55:37,623 --> 00:55:40,248
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

894
00:56:10,248 --> 00:56:13,290
( men shouting )

895
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:36,706
( chatter )

896
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:05,081
( door opens )

897
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:11,373
- It's done.
- It is.

898
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:17,373
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

899
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:21,164
Did we fight well?

900
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:24,206
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

901
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,331
It was never our forte.

902
00:57:26,332 --> 00:57:28,415
Golden roses, indeed.

903
00:57:30,332 --> 00:57:32,372
Your brother
and his new queen

904
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:35,289
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

905
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,580
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

906
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:40,164
Well, it is to me,

907
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,497
but my fond
childhood memories

908
00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:44,039
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

909
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,164
So you just
let them take it?

910
00:57:46,165 --> 00:57:48,206
For now.
They won't be able to hold it.

911
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:50,747
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

912
00:57:50,748 --> 00:57:52,747
we emptied the larders
before we left.

913
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:54,997
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

914
00:57:54,998 --> 00:57:58,414
and march all the way
across Westeros.

915
00:57:58,415 --> 00:58:01,580
And you took your army,
your real army,

916
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:03,456
and went
where they weren't.

917
00:58:03,457 --> 00:58:06,788
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

918
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,830
There are always
lessons in failures.

919
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:12,415
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

920
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:16,580
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

921
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:18,331
If he was so clever,

922
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,080
why didn't he take
Highgarden

923
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:23,788
the moment
your gold mines ran dry?

924
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:25,331
( scoffs )

925
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:29,247
I suppose I'll be able
to ask him myself soon enough.

926
00:58:29,248 --> 00:58:32,332
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

927
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:37,289
How will you do it?

928
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,747
With that sword?

929
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:42,122
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

930
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:44,456
Not that
he ever used it.

931
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:46,123
What did he call it?

932
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:50,080
Widow's Wail.

933
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:52,290
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

934
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:59,289
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

935
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,331
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

936
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:06,497
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

937
00:59:06,498 --> 00:59:08,538
They were necessary.

938
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:10,580
And whatever
I imagined necessary

939
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:14,497
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

940
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:19,123
But your sister
has done things...

941
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:23,122
I was incapable
of imagining.

942
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:25,955
That was
my prize mistake--

943
00:59:25,956 --> 00:59:28,498
a failure
of imagination.

944
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:32,289
She's a monster,
you do know that?

945
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,456
To you, I'm sure.

946
00:59:34,457 --> 00:59:36,331
To others as well.

947
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:39,830
But after we've won
and there's no one left to oppose us,

948
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:44,164
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

949
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:47,873
do you really think they'll wring their hands
over the way she built it?

950
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,497
You love her.

951
00:59:52,498 --> 00:59:54,289
You really do
love her.

952
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,747
You poor fool.

953
00:59:56,748 --> 00:59:58,497
She'll be
the end of you.

954
00:59:58,498 --> 01:00:01,039
Possibly.

955
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,830
Not much
to be gained

956
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:04,872
from discussing it
with you, though, is there?

957
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:07,580
What better person
to discuss it with?

958
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:09,497
What better guarantee
could you have

959
01:00:09,498 --> 01:00:13,538
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

960
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:16,580
But perhaps
you're right.

961
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,164
If she's driven you
this far,

962
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:20,581
it's gone beyond
your control.

963
01:00:21,873 --> 01:00:23,872
Yes.

964
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:25,332
It has.

965
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,456
She's a disease.

966
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:31,414
I regret my role
in spreading it.

967
01:00:31,415 --> 01:00:32,997
You will, too.

968
01:00:32,998 --> 01:00:34,748
I think
we're done here.

969
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:39,207
How will it happen?

970
01:00:40,748 --> 01:00:42,663
Cersei had
several ideas.

971
01:00:42,664 --> 01:00:44,080
Whipping you
through the streets

972
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:46,747
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

973
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:50,581
Flaying you alive and hanging you from
the walls of King's Landing.

974
01:00:53,748 --> 01:00:55,539
I talked her
out of those.

975
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:14,206
Will there be pain?

976
01:01:14,207 --> 01:01:16,788
No. I made sure
of that.

977
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:18,123
That's good.

978
01:01:30,915 --> 01:01:32,915
I'd hate to die
like your son.

979
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,580
Clawing at my neck,

980
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:38,456
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

981
01:01:38,457 --> 01:01:42,289
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

982
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,663
Must have been
horrible for you,

983
01:01:44,664 --> 01:01:48,122
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

984
01:01:48,123 --> 01:01:50,705
It was horrible
enough for me.

985
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:53,372
A shocking scene.

986
01:01:53,373 --> 01:01:56,165
Not at all
what I intended.

987
01:01:58,123 --> 01:02:02,706
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

988
01:02:07,664 --> 01:02:09,830
Tell Cersei.

989
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:12,290
I want her to know
it was me.

990
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:43,706
♪ <font color="#FFFF00">( music playing )</font> ♪

991
01:03:56,075 --> 01:03:57,616
My only venture at this moment

992
01:03:57,617 --> 01:04:00,241
is reestablishing control
over this continent

993
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:01,784
and every person on it.

DAENERYS TARGARYEN:
All my allies are gone.

995
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,450
I'm losing.

996
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:10,158
You can count on the Iron Bank.
As soon as the gold arrives.

997
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:12,742
Enough with the clever plans.
